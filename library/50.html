sequence a_n divided by n^α is always between 1/2 and 2. The sequence is defined by a₁ = 1 and a_{n+1} = sqrt(a_n² + 1/a_n). Hmm, let&#39;s try to figure this out step by step.First, let me understand how the sequence behaves. Maybe I can compute the first few terms to see a pattern. Starting with a₁ = 1. Then:a₂ = sqrt(1² + 1/1) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414a₃ = sqrt((sqrt(2))² + 1/(sqrt(2))) = sqrt(2 + 1/√2) ≈ sqrt(2 + 0.707) ≈ sqrt(2.707) ≈ 1.646a₄ = sqrt(1.646² + 1/1.646) ≈ sqrt(2.709 + 0.607) ≈ sqrt(3.316) ≈ 1.821a₅ = sqrt(1.821² + 1/1.821) ≈ sqrt(3.316 + 0.549) ≈ sqrt(3.865) ≈ 1.966a₆ ≈ sqrt(1.966² + 1/1.966) ≈ sqrt(3.865 + 0.508) ≈ sqrt(4.373) ≈ 2.091a₇ ≈ sqrt(2.091² + 1/2.091) ≈ sqrt(4.373 + 0.478) ≈ sqrt(4.851) ≈ 2.202a₈ ≈ sqrt(2.202² + 1/2.202) ≈ sqrt(4.851 + 0.454) ≈ sqrt(5.305) ≈ 2.303Hmm, so the sequence seems to be increasing. Each term is sqrt(previous term squared plus 1 over previous term). Since all terms are positive, and each time we add a positive number before taking the square root, the sequence is strictly increasing. So it&#39;s growing, but how fast? The question is about finding an exponent α such that a_n is roughly n^α, within a factor of 2.Since we need to bound a_n between (1/2)n^α and 2n^α, the key is to determine the rate of growth of a_n. Let&#39;s think about how sequences defined recursively via a_{n+1} = sqrt(a_n² + something) behave. If the something is a constant, then the sequence would grow linearly. But here, the something is 1/a_n, which is decreasing as a_n increases. So maybe the growth rate is sublinear? Wait, but in the examples above, a_n is increasing, but the increments are getting smaller. Wait, actually, the terms are increasing, but the amount added each time is 1/a_n, which is decreasing. So maybe the growth rate is slowing down? Hmm.Alternatively, maybe we can model this recurrence relation with a differential equation. If we approximate the difference a_{n+1} - a_n in terms of a_n, then we can get a differential equation that approximates the sequence&#39;s behavior.Let&#39;s denote a_n as a function a(n). Then, the recurrence is:a(n+1) = sqrt(a(n)² + 1/a(n))Let me square both sides:a(n+1)² = a(n)² + 1/a(n)So, the difference between a(n+1)² and a(n)² is 1/a(n). Let&#39;s write this as:a(n+1)² - a(n)² = 1/a(n)If we consider this as a difference equation, we can approximate it for large n as a differential equation. Let’s let h = 1 (since the step is 1 in n), then the left-hand side is similar to the derivative of a(n)² with respect to n. So:d/dn [a(n)²] ≈ a(n+1)² - a(n)² = 1/a(n)Therefore:2a(n) * a&#39;(n) ≈ 1/a(n)Solving for a&#39;(n):a&#39;(n) ≈ 1/(2a(n)²)This differential equation suggests that the rate of change of a(n) is inversely proportional to a(n) squared. Let&#39;s write that as:da/dn = 1/(2a²)This is a separable differential equation. Let&#39;s separate variables:2a² da = dnIntegrate both sides:∫2a² da = ∫dnThe left integral is (2/3)a³ + C, and the right integral is n + C. So:(2/3)a³ = n + CSolving for a:a³ = (3/2)(n + C)Therefore,a(n) ≈ [(3/2)(n + C)]^{1/3}So for large n, the constant C becomes negligible, and we have:a(n) ≈ (3/2 n)^{1/3}So that suggests α = 1/3. So the conjecture is that a(n) grows like n^{1/3}, so we can take α = 1/3. Then, the ratio a(n)/n^{1/3} should be bounded between 1/2 and 2 for all n. Let me check with the computed terms.For n=1: a₁=1, 1^{1/3}=1, so ratio=1. That&#39;s within [1/2, 2].n=2: a₂≈1.414, 2^{1/3}≈1.26, ratio≈1.414/1.26≈1.12. Still within bounds.n=3: a₃≈1.646, 3^{1/3}≈1.442, ratio≈1.646/1.442≈1.14. Still okay.n=4: a₄≈1.821, 4^{1/3}≈1.587, ratio≈1.821/1.587≈1.15.Wait, but as n increases, the ratio seems to be increasing. Let&#39;s check n=8: a₈≈2.303, 8^{1/3}=2, ratio≈2.303/2≈1.15. Hmm, so it&#39;s hovering around 1.15. So maybe even asymptotically approaching something like (3/2)^{1/3}? Since our approximation was a(n)≈(3/2 n)^{1/3}, which would be (3/2)^{1/3} * n^{1/3}. So the ratio a(n)/n^{1/3}≈(3/2)^{1/3}≈1.1447, which is consistent with the computed terms. So if the ratio approaches around 1.1447, which is between 1/2 and 2, then for all n, the ratio is bounded by 1/2 and 2. But wait, maybe even tighter bounds? But the question only asks to show that there exists α such that the ratio is between 1/2 and 2. So if α=1/3 works, then that&#39;s the answer.But we need to formalize this. The problem is to prove such an α exists. So maybe we can use induction to show that for α=1/3, the ratio a_n /n^{1/3} stays between 1/2 and 2.Alternatively, maybe we can use the differential equation approximation to bound the sequence. Let me think.First, let&#39;s assume that a_n behaves roughly like C n^{1/3}. Then, from the differential equation, we have that a(n) ≈ (3/2 n)^{1/3}. So C=(3/2)^{1/3}≈1.1447. So if the actual sequence is approaching this, then the ratio a_n /n^{1/3} approaches C≈1.1447, which is between 1/2 and 2. But we need to show that for all n, the ratio is between 1/2 and 2. However, for small n, like n=1, the ratio is 1, which is okay. But maybe for some n, the ratio could dip below 1/2 or go above 2? Wait, but in our computed terms, the ratio increases from 1 to around 1.15 and seems to stabilize. So perhaps it&#39;s bounded above 1 and below, say, 1.2. But maybe in the initial terms, it&#39;s lower. Wait, n=1: ratio 1. n=2: ~1.12, n=3: ~1.14, etc. So maybe it&#39;s always above 1. But the problem allows for 1/2 to 2, which is a wider range. So maybe even if our approximation is that it&#39;s around 1.14, but to prove that it&#39;s always between 1/2 and 2, we need to establish upper and lower bounds.Alternatively, perhaps we can use mathematical induction to show that for α=1/3, the inequalities hold. Let&#39;s attempt that.Base case: n=1. a₁=1. 1 /1^{1/3}=1. So 1 is between 1/2 and 2. Check.Now, suppose that for some k ≥1, we have (1/2) k^{1/3} ≤ a_k ≤ 2 k^{1/3}. We need to show that (1/2)(k+1)^{1/3} ≤ a_{k+1} ≤ 2(k+1)^{1/3}.Given that a_{k+1} = sqrt(a_k² + 1/a_k). Let&#39;s try to bound this expression.First, upper bound. Assume a_k ≤ 2 k^{1/3}. Then,a_{k+1}² = a_k² + 1/a_k ≤ (4 k^{2/3}) + 1/( (1/2) k^{1/3} ) ) [Wait, here we need a lower bound on a_k to bound 1/a_k. If a_k ≥ (1/2)k^{1/3}, then 1/a_k ≤ 2/k^{1/3}]So:a_{k+1}² = a_k² + 1/a_k ≤ (4 k^{2/3}) + 2/k^{1/3}We need to show that this is ≤ [2 (k+1)^{1/3}]² = 4 (k+1)^{2/3}So need to check if 4k^{2/3} + 2/k^{1/3} ≤ 4(k+1)^{2/3}Divide both sides by 4:k^{2/3} + (1/(2 k^{1/3})) ≤ (k+1)^{2/3}Is this inequality true? Let&#39;s see. Let’s denote t = k^{1/3}, so k = t³. Then:Left-hand side: t² + 1/(2 t)Right-hand side: (t³ +1)^{2/3}We need to check if t² + 1/(2t) ≤ (t³ +1)^{2/3}Hmm, not sure. Let’s test with t=1 (k=1):Left: 1 + 1/2 = 1.5Right: (1 +1)^{2/3} = 2^{2/3} ≈1.587. So 1.5 ≤1.587, which holds.For t=2 (k=8):Left: 4 + 1/(4) =4.25Right: (8 +1)^{2/3}=9^{2/3}= (3²)^{2/3}=3^{4/3}≈4.326. So 4.25 ≤4.326, holds.For t=3 (k=27):Left:9 +1/(6)≈9.1667Right:28^{2/3}. 28 is between 27 and 64, so cube root of 28≈3.036, squared≈9.217. So 9.1667 ≤9.217, holds.Similarly, as t increases, the right-hand side is (t³ +1)^{2/3} ≈ t² (1 + 1/t³)^{2/3} ≈ t² (1 + (2/3)(1/t³)) ≈ t² + 2/(3 t). The left-hand side is t² +1/(2t). For large t, 2/(3t) vs 1/(2t). Since 2/3 ≈0.666 and 1/2=0.5, so 2/(3t) &gt;1/(2t). Therefore, the right-hand side is larger than left-hand side for large t. So the inequality seems to hold for all t≥1. Therefore, the upper bound induction step holds.Similarly, for the lower bound. Suppose a_k ≥ (1/2)k^{1/3}. Then,a_{k+1}² =a_k² +1/a_k ≥ ( (1/4)k^{2/3} ) + 1/(2k^{1/3})Need to show that this is ≥ [ (1/2)(k+1)^{1/3} ]² = (1/4)(k+1)^{2/3}So:(1/4)k^{2/3} +1/(2k^{1/3}) ≥ (1/4)(k+1)^{2/3}Multiply both sides by 4:k^{2/3} + 2/k^{1/3} ≥ (k+1)^{2/3}Again, let’s substitute t=k^{1/3}, so k=t³:Left-hand side: t² + 2/tRight-hand side: (t³ +1)^{2/3}We need to check if t² + 2/t ≥ (t³ +1)^{2/3}Test t=1 (k=1):Left:1 +2=3Right:2^{2/3}≈1.587. 3≥1.587, holds.t=2 (k=8):Left:4 +1=5Right:9^{2/3}=4.326. 5≥4.326, holds.t=3 (k=27):Left:9 + 2/3≈9.6667Right:28^{2/3}≈9.217. 9.6667≥9.217, holds.As t increases, (t³ +1)^{2/3}≈t²(1 +1/t³)^{2/3}≈t² + (2/3)/t. So left-hand side is t² + 2/t, right-hand side≈t² + 2/(3t). So t² +2/t ≥ t² +2/(3t) for t&gt;0, which is true since 2/t &gt;2/(3t) for t&gt;0. Therefore, the inequality holds for all t≥1. Therefore, the lower bound induction step holds.Therefore, by mathematical induction, the inequalities (1/2)n^{1/3} ≤a_n ≤2n^{1/3} hold for all n≥1. Hence, α=1/3 satisfies the condition.But wait, let me check the induction step again. For the upper bound, we assumed a_k ≤2k^{1/3} and showed a_{k+1}² ≤4(k+1)^{2/3}, hence a_{k+1} ≤2(k+1)^{1/3}. Similarly for the lower bound. So the induction holds, meaning that if the base case is true (which it is), and the induction step holds, then the inequality is valid for all n. Therefore, α=1/3 works.So the answer is that such an α exists, specifically α=1/3, and the ratio is bounded between 1/2 and 2 for all n.Final Answerboxed{alpha = dfrac{1}{3}}</p><div class="divider" data-v-f87f2ed0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f87f2ed0><span class="icon" data-v-f87f2ed0>✅:</span>To prove that there exists a positive number (alpha) such that (frac{1}{2} leq frac{a_{n}}{n^{alpha}} leq 2) for all (n = 1, 2, 3, ldots), we analyze the sequence (a_n) defined by (a_1 = 1) and (a_{n+1} = sqrt{a_n^2 + frac{1}{a_n}}).First, we approximate the behavior of the sequence using a differential equation.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better. First, the problem is about points in a plane with distances defined between every pair. For six points, we have to consider all pairwise distances. The ratio λ₆ is the maximum distance divided by the minimum distance among all these pairs. The goal is to show that this ratio can&#39;t be smaller than √3. So, no matter how you arrange six points in the plane, the longest distance divided by the shortest will be at least √3. Interesting.I remember something about this kind of problem. Maybe it&#39;s related to graph theory or maybe something about geometric configurations. Wait, perhaps it&#39;s similar to the concept of the chromatic number of the plane, but that&#39;s more about coloring points so that no two points at a certain distance have the same color. Not exactly the same, but maybe related.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s about optimal packings or sphere packings. For example, placing points in a hexagonal lattice might be efficient in some sense. But here, the problem is about the ratio of maximum to minimum distances. Let me think.Suppose we have six points. To minimize the ratio λ₆, we need all the distances to be as close as possible. That is, the points should be arranged such that the distances between them don&#39;t vary too much. The minimal possible ratio would occur when the points are as &quot;evenly spread out&quot; as possible. So maybe arranging them in a regular hexagon?Wait, in a regular hexagon, all the sides are equal, and the distance between opposite vertices is twice the side length. So the maximum distance would be twice the side length, and the minimum distance is the side length. Then the ratio would be 2. But 2 is larger than √3 (which is approximately 1.732). So that&#39;s not helpful because the problem is to prove that the ratio can&#39;t be smaller than √3. So if in a regular hexagon, the ratio is 2, which is larger than √3, but maybe there&#39;s a better configuration where the ratio is smaller?But perhaps the regular hexagon isn&#39;t the optimal configuration here. Maybe there&#39;s a way to arrange six points where the ratio is exactly √3? If that&#39;s possible, then we need to show that you can&#39;t have a ratio lower than that. Alternatively, maybe regardless of how you arrange six points, there must be at least one pair of points with distance at least √3 times the minimum distance.Alternatively, maybe this is related to the concept of a complete graph with six vertices embedded in the plane, where edges have lengths, and we need to analyze the ratio of the longest to the shortest edge.But how do we approach such a proof? Maybe using graph theory, maybe using geometric arguments. Let&#39;s think.First, let&#39;s recall some theorems or principles in combinatorial geometry that might apply here. The pigeonhole principle comes to mind. Maybe if we can partition the plane into regions and use the pigeonhole principle to show that two points must lie in certain regions, leading to a minimum or maximum distance.Alternatively, maybe using the concept of the Erdős problem on distinct distances, but that&#39;s about the number of distinct distances, not the ratio. Hmm.Wait, perhaps considering unit distance graphs. But here, we are not restricting to unit distances; instead, we are considering the ratio between the maximum and minimum distances.Another thought: If we fix the minimum distance between any two points to be 1, then we need to show that the maximum distance is at least √3. Alternatively, if we can show that among six points with minimum distance 1, there must be two points at least √3 apart. Is that the case?Alternatively, maybe using graph embeddings. For example, the complete graph on six vertices can&#39;t be embedded in the plane without some edges being too long compared to others.Wait, perhaps an approach using convex hulls. If the six points form a convex hexagon, then maybe we can analyze the distances. But convex hulls might not necessarily cover all cases, as some points can be inside the hull.Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of circles. If we place six points in the plane, and the minimum distance is d, then each point must be at least d apart from every other point. So, each point has a circle of radius d/2 around it, and these circles can&#39;t overlap. So, the problem reduces to packing six non-overlapping circles of radius d/2 in the plane such that the maximum distance between any two centers is minimized. Then, the question is, what is the minimal possible maximum distance between any two centers in such a packing? Then, the ratio λ₆ would be that maximum distance divided by d, and we need to show that this ratio is at least √3.So, if we can show that in any packing of six circles with radius d/2, the maximum distance between centers is at least √3 d, then that would prove λ₆ ≥ √3. So, perhaps this is equivalent to proving that the minimal enclosing circle for six non-overlapping circles of radius d/2 has a diameter of at least √3 d.Alternatively, maybe this is related to the concept of circle packing. The densest packing of circles in the plane is the hexagonal packing, which might be relevant here. In a hexagonal packing, each circle is surrounded by six others, arranged in a hexagon. The distance between centers in that case is 2r, where r is the radius. But if we have six circles around a central one, then the distance from the center to any surrounding circle is 2r, and the distance between two surrounding circles is 2r. Wait, no. If the radius is r, then the centers are separated by 2r. Wait, actually, if two circles each of radius r are tangent, the distance between centers is 2r. In a hexagonal packing, each circle is tangent to six others. So, the distance from the center to any adjacent center is 2r. But the distance between two non-adjacent centers in the hexagonal packing would be larger. For example, in a hexagonal lattice, moving two steps in adjacent directions would give a distance of 2r * √3. Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s clarify.Suppose we have a central circle at (0,0) with radius r. Then, six surrounding circles are placed at angles 0°, 60°, 120°, etc., each at a distance of 2r from the center. The coordinates of the surrounding centers would be (2r, 0), (r, r√3), (-r, r√3), etc. The distance between two adjacent surrounding centers would be 2r. Wait, is that true?Wait, let&#39;s compute the distance between (2r, 0) and (r, r√3). Using the distance formula: sqrt[(2r - r)^2 + (0 - r√3)^2] = sqrt[(r)^2 + (r√3)^2] = sqrt(r² + 3r²) = sqrt(4r²) = 2r. So, indeed, the distance between any two adjacent surrounding centers is 2r. However, the distance between centers that are opposite each other would be 4r (from (2r,0) to (-2r,0)), but in the hexagonal packing with a central circle, you don&#39;t have points opposite each other except through the center. Wait, in the hexagonal packing, you have layers. The first layer around the central circle has six circles. The second layer would have twelve, and so on. But if we&#39;re just considering seven circles (one central and six surrounding), then the maximum distance between any two surrounding circles is 4r (diametrically opposite). But in that case, the ratio between the maximum and minimum distance would be 4r / 2r = 2. So again, the ratio is 2, which is larger than √3. But the problem states that λ₆ is at least √3, so perhaps there&#39;s a way to arrange six points (without a central point) such that the ratio is smaller?Wait, but in the hexagonal packing with a central point, we have seven points. The problem here is six points. So maybe arranging six points in a slightly different configuration?Alternatively, think of a regular pentagon with a point in the center. Wait, a regular pentagon has five points. Adding a sixth point in the center. Then, the distance from the center to the vertices is some value, and the edges of the pentagon are longer. But not sure if that would give a better ratio.Alternatively, arrange the six points as two equilateral triangles. Maybe one equilateral triangle and another rotated equilateral triangle on top of it, forming a star-like shape. Let&#39;s see. If you have two equilateral triangles, one rotated by 60 degrees, their intersection forms a regular hexagon. Wait, actually, that&#39;s the star of David shape, which is a six-pointed star made of two overlapping triangles. The vertices of this star are six points. Let&#39;s analyze the distances there.Suppose each triangle has side length 1. The distance between adjacent points on the star would be the same as the side length of the hexagon formed. Wait, maybe I need to compute coordinates.Let me try to place the points. Let&#39;s take two equilateral triangles: one with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), (0.5, √3/2), and another triangle rotated by 180 degrees. Wait, but that might not create a star. Alternatively, overlapping two triangles at 60 degrees. Maybe the vertices are at the six points of the star. Let me recall that the regular six-pointed star (hexagram) is formed by overlapping two equilateral triangles. Each point of the star is a vertex of both triangles. The distance between adjacent points on the star is equal to the side length of the triangles. However, the distance between non-adjacent points might be longer. Wait, actually, in a regular hexagram, the distance between opposite points is twice the side length, similar to the regular hexagon.But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.Let me recall that in the plane, the maximum number of equidistant points is 3, forming an equilateral triangle. For four points, the regular tetrahedron isn&#39;t planar, so in the plane, the regular square has a longer diagonal than its side, so the ratio is √2. For five points, arranging them as a regular pentagon would give a ratio of the diagonal to the side, which is the golden ratio (approximately 1.618), which is less than √3 (approximately 1.732). Wait, but that&#39;s for five points. However, maybe when you add more points, you can&#39;t keep the ratio as low?Wait, hold on. For four points in a square, the ratio is √2. For five points in a regular pentagon, the ratio is the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618. For six points in a regular hexagon, the ratio is 2, as the distance between opposite vertices is twice the side length. But the problem states that for six points, the ratio is at least √3. So, the regular pentagon has a lower ratio, but it&#39;s only five points. When we go to six points, maybe the regular pentagon plus a point somewhere would require the ratio to jump up to at least √3. So, perhaps the minimal ratio for six points is indeed √3, achieved by some configuration, and we need to prove that no configuration can have a lower ratio.Alternatively, maybe the minimal configuration is achieved by a regular hexagon with side length 1, but then the maximum distance is 2, so ratio 2. But 2 is larger than √3, so that doesn&#39;t help. Hmm.Wait, maybe the minimal ratio is achieved not by a regular hexagon but by another configuration. For example, the vertices of a regular pentagon with a point at the center. Let&#39;s compute the distances there.In a regular pentagon with a center point, the distance from the center to each vertex is the same. Let’s denote the side length of the pentagon as s. The distance from the center to a vertex (the radius) R is given by R = s / (2 sin(π/5)) ≈ s / (2 * 0.5878) ≈ s / 1.1756 ≈ 0.8507s. Wait, so if the side length is s, the radius is about 0.85s. Then, the distances between the center and the vertices are about 0.85s, and the distances between adjacent vertices are s. The distances between non-adjacent vertices are longer. For example, the distance between two vertices separated by one other vertex in the pentagon is s times the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618s. So, in this configuration, the minimum distance is between the center and the vertices (≈0.85s), and the maximum distance is between the non-adjacent vertices (≈1.618s). Then, the ratio would be 1.618s / 0.85s ≈ 1.902, which is still higher than √3 ≈ 1.732. So even this configuration doesn&#39;t achieve the ratio of √3.Hmm. Maybe another configuration. How about three pairs of points arranged in two equilateral triangles? Suppose we have two equilateral triangles, one with side length 1 and the other with side length √3, arranged concentrically. Wait, but that might not work. Alternatively, place three points as an equilateral triangle with side length 1, and the other three points as another equilateral triangle rotated by 60 degrees and scaled down. Not sure.Alternatively, arrange all six points in an equilateral lattice. For example, a triangular lattice with points at the vertices of small equilateral triangles. If we take a subset of such a lattice with six points, maybe the ratio can be minimized. But it&#39;s unclear.Alternatively, think of the complete graph K₆. Each edge has a length, and we need the ratio of the longest to the shortest edge. To minimize this ratio, we need all edges to be as similar in length as possible. But in the plane, you can&#39;t embed K₆ with all edges equal, because K₆ is not a planar graph, and even in 3D, you need at least three dimensions to have all edges equal (as in a regular simplex). So, in the plane, some edges will have to be longer or shorter.Wait, maybe apply graph planarity here. K₆ is not planar, so any embedding of K₆ in the plane must have edge crossings, but we&#39;re just talking about the distances between points, not drawing the edges without crossings. So planarity might not be directly relevant.Alternatively, use geometric graph theory. Maybe apply some theorem about the number of edges or distances required.Wait, another idea: using the concept of the minimal maximum distance among n points with a given minimal distance. This is related to the problem of optimal circle packing, where you want to place n circles of radius r in the plane without overlapping, and minimize the size of the container. If the container is a circle, then the minimal radius needed to contain n circles of radius r is related to the maximum distance between centers plus r. But perhaps this is more complicated.Alternatively, consider that if we have six points with minimal distance 1, we can try to bound the diameter (max distance) from below. If we can show that the diameter must be at least √3, then the ratio λ₆ is at least √3. So, how to show that among six points with all pairs at least 1 apart, there must be two points at least √3 apart.Wait, this seems like a sphere packing problem in 2D. If you have six circles of radius 0.5 packed in the plane without overlapping, the centers must be at least 1 apart. Then, the question becomes: what is the minimal diameter of such a packing? If we can show that the diameter is at least √3, then we&#39;re done.So, perhaps this is a known result in circle packing. Let me recall. The densest circle packing in the plane is the hexagonal packing, but that&#39;s for an infinite plane. For finite packings, the most efficient (densest) packing might still be similar to hexagonal, but for six circles, maybe arranging them in a hexagonal pattern with one circle at the center? Wait, but with six circles, you could have a central circle and five around it, but five around one doesn&#39;t tile as efficiently as six around one. Wait, six around one would make seven circles. But we only have six. So, perhaps six circles arranged in a hexagonal pattern without a central circle. That is, a regular hexagon. In this case, the diameter (distance between opposite vertices) would be 2 times the side length. If the minimal distance between any two circles is 1 (the side length), then the diameter is 2, so the ratio is 2. However, in this case, the diameter is 2, which is larger than √3. So if we can find a different packing where the diameter is smaller, but still respecting the minimal distance of 1, then perhaps the ratio can be smaller. But according to the problem statement, no such packing exists; the diameter must be at least √3.Therefore, to prove that λ₆ ≥ √3, we need to show that in any packing of six circles with radius 0.5 (so centers at least 1 apart), the diameter (maximum distance between any two centers) is at least √3.Alternatively, phrased differently: any six points in the plane with all pairwise distances at least 1 must have at least two points at distance ≥ √3. Then, λ₆, being the ratio of the maximum to minimum distance, would be at least √3/1 = √3.So, if we can prove that, then the problem is solved. So, how to prove that among six points with minimum distance 1, there must be two points at least √3 apart.Maybe using graph theory. Consider the complete graph on six vertices, each edge representing the distance between two points. If all edges are at least 1, then we need to show that at least one edge is at least √3.Alternatively, use geometric arguments. Let&#39;s think about the plane and how to place six points as close as possible without being too close.One approach is to use the concept of the minimal enclosing circle. If we can find the minimal radius R such that six circles of radius 0.5 can be packed inside a circle of radius R. Then, the diameter would be 2R. If we can show that 2R ≥ √3, then R ≥ √3 / 2 ≈ 0.866. But the minimal enclosing circle for six circles of radius 0.5... Hmm, if arranged in a regular hexagon, the centers are on a circle of radius 1 (since the distance between adjacent centers is 1, so the radius is 1/(2 sin(π/6)) = 1/(2 * 0.5) = 1. So the enclosing circle would have radius 1 + 0.5 = 1.5. Wait, but that&#39;s considering the circles themselves. Wait, maybe this is a different problem. Wait, if we have six circles of radius 0.5 packed so their centers are within a circle of radius R, then the diameter of the packing (distance between farthest centers) would be 2R. But I need to relate this to the minimal enclosing circle for the centers. If the centers are packed in a circle of radius r, then the maximum distance between any two centers is 2r. So, to have the maximum distance (2r) as small as possible, we need to arrange the six centers within a circle of minimal radius r. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal r such that six points can be placed within a circle of radius r with all pairwise distances at least 1. Then, we need to show that 2r ≥ √3, i.e., r ≥ √3/2.Is this a known result? The minimal covering circle for six points with minimum distance 1. Let me check.I recall that for points on a circle, the maximal minimal distance between them is achieved when they are equally spaced. For six points on a circle, equally spaced would form a regular hexagon with side length equal to the radius. Wait, no. The side length s of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius r is equal to r. So, if we have six points on a circle of radius r, spaced 60 degrees apart, then the distance between adjacent points is 2r sin(π/6) = 2r * 0.5 = r. Therefore, to have the minimal distance between adjacent points equal to 1, we need r = 1. Therefore, the regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius 1 has all adjacent points at distance 1, and the diameter is 2. However, the distance between opposite points is 2, which is the diameter.But in this case, the maximum distance is 2, so the ratio is 2. However, if we arrange the six points not on a circle but in some other configuration, perhaps the maximum distance can be reduced. For example, placing five points on a circle and one in the center. Wait, but the distance from the center to the circle points would need to be at least 1, so the radius of the circle would have to be at least 1. Then, the distance between two points on the circle could be as small as the side length of the pentagon, which is 2r sin(π/5) ≈ 2 * 1 * 0.5878 ≈ 1.1756, which is greater than 1. So, the minimal distance in this case is 1 (from center to perimeter), and the maximum distance is the diameter of the circle, which is 2. So the ratio is still 2.Alternatively, arranging the six points as two separate triangles. Suppose we have two equilateral triangles, each with side length 1, placed such that the distance between any two points from different triangles is at least 1. How far apart do the triangles need to be?If we have two equilateral triangles, perhaps placed side by side. The minimal distance between the triangles would depend on their orientation. If they are aligned such that a vertex from one triangle points towards a vertex from the other, the minimal distance between the triangles would need to be at least 1. However, the distance between the farthest points would be the distance between the farthest vertices of the two triangles. If each triangle has side length 1, and they are placed with a minimal distance of 1 between them, the maximum distance might be more than √3. Let&#39;s see.Suppose one triangle is placed with a base at the bottom, and the other triangle is placed above it, flipped upside down, with the minimal vertical distance between them being 1. The height of an equilateral triangle with side length 1 is (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So, the total vertical distance from the base of the lower triangle to the apex of the upper triangle would be 0.866 + 1 + 0.866 ≈ 2.732. The horizontal distance between the furthest points would be 1 (the side length). So, the maximum distance would be sqrt((2.732/2)^2 + (1/2)^2) Wait, maybe not. Wait, actually, the horizontal distance between the two farthest points (one from each triangle) would be 1 unit apart horizontally if the triangles are aligned. Wait, no. If the triangles are placed vertically apart by 1 unit, then the horizontal distance depends on how they&#39;re shifted.This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is needed.Perhaps using the pigeonhole principle. Divide the plane into regions such that if six points are placed, two points must lie in the same or adjacent regions, forcing a certain distance. Wait, but how?Alternatively, consider that in the plane, the maximum number of points that can be placed with all pairwise distances at least 1 and all lying within a circle of radius √3 / 2 is five. If that were the case, then six points would require a larger radius, hence a larger maximum distance. But I need to verify this.Wait, let&#39;s suppose we have a circle of radius √3 / 2 ≈ 0.866. Can we place six points inside this circle such that all pairwise distances are at least 1? If not, then six points would require a larger circle, hence the maximum distance (diameter) would be at least √3.But how to check if six points can fit in a circle of radius √3 / 2 with all distances at least 1. Let&#39;s consider a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle of radius √3 / 2. The side length s of such a hexagon is equal to the radius, so s = √3 / 2 ≈ 0.866. But the distance between adjacent points would be s, which is less than 1. Therefore, such a configuration would have distances less than 1, which doesn&#39;t satisfy the requirement. So, to have all distances at least 1, the regular hexagon would need a larger radius.Alternatively, if we try to place six points within a circle of radius √3 / 2, but not in a regular hexagon. Maybe some other configuration. But given that even the regular hexagon with radius √3 / 2 has side lengths ≈0.866 &lt;1, any other configuration would likely have even shorter minimal distances. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to place six points within a circle of radius √3 / 2 with all pairwise distances at least 1.Hence, six points with minimal distance 1 must lie within a circle of radius greater than √3 / 2, so the maximum distance between any two points must be greater than √3. Wait, but the diameter of the circle would be 2 * radius. So, if the radius must be greater than √3 / 2, then the diameter must be greater than √3. Therefore, the maximum distance between two points is greater than √3, hence the ratio λ₆ is greater than √3. Therefore, proving that λ₆ ≥ √3.But is this argument rigorous? Let me check.Assume for contradiction that all six points lie within a circle of radius √3 / 2. Then, the maximum distance between any two points is at most √3. But we need to show that in such a case, the minimal distance between some pair of points would be less than 1, which contradicts the minimal distance being 1. Therefore, by contradiction, the six points cannot all lie within a circle of radius √3 / 2, so at least two points must be more than √3 apart.To formalize this, we can use the concept of packing density or divide the circle into regions.Alternatively, use the theorem by Paul Erdős and others about the minimum diameter of a set of points with a given minimal distance. Let me recall. There&#39;s a theorem that states that the minimal diameter of n points in the plane with minimal distance 1 is known for certain n. For n=6, it might be √3.Alternatively, refer to the book &quot;Packing and Covering&quot; by G. Fejes Tóth. According to some sources, the minimal diameter for six points with minimal distance 1 is indeed √3, achieved by placing the points at the vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 1, but wait, no. Wait, in a regular hexagon with side length 1, the diameter is 2. So that can&#39;t be.Wait, maybe the configuration is different. Let me think. If we arrange five points as a regular pentagon with side length 1, and the sixth point at the center. The distance from the center to the vertices is R = 1/(2 sin(π/5)) ≈ 0.8507. Then, the distance from the center to the vertices is less than 1, which violates the minimal distance requirement. Therefore, to have all distances at least 1, the regular pentagon with a center point would need the radius R ≥ 1. Then, the side length of the pentagon would be 2R sin(π/5) ≈ 2 * 1 * 0.5878 ≈ 1.1756. Then, the distances between adjacent vertices would be ≈1.1756, which is greater than 1. The diameter of the pentagon is 2R ≈ 2, so the maximum distance is 2. The ratio would be 2 / 1 = 2.But this is not helpful. So, perhaps there&#39;s another configuration where the minimal distance is 1 and the maximum distance is √3. Maybe arranging the points as the vertices of two equilateral triangles, one rotated with respect to the other.Suppose we have an equilateral triangle with side length 1, and another equilateral triangle with side length 1 rotated by 60 degrees and placed such that each vertex of the second triangle is at the midpoint of the edges of the first triangle. Wait, but then the distance from the original triangle&#39;s vertices to the new triangle&#39;s vertices would be less than 1. For example, the distance from a vertex of the first triangle to a midpoint of its edge is 0.5, which is less than 1. So that won&#39;t work.Alternatively, arrange three pairs of points each separated by 1 unit, arranged in a larger triangle. Not sure.Wait, perhaps the configuration is a regular hexagon with side length 1/√3. Then, the distance between opposite vertices would be 2/√3 ≈ 1.1547, and the distance between adjacent vertices is 1/√3 ≈ 0.577. But this is less than 1, which violates the minimal distance. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, scale the regular hexagon so that the minimal distance is 1. In a regular hexagon, the minimal distance is the side length. So, if we set the side length to 1, then the opposite vertices are distance 2 apart. So, the ratio is 2. But again, this is larger than √3.Wait, perhaps instead of a regular hexagon, arrange the six points in a different polygon. For example, a rectangle with two points on each side. Not sure.Alternatively, think of three pairs of points arranged on the vertices of a large equilateral triangle, each pair separated by 1 unit. For example, each vertex of the large triangle has two points separated by 1 unit. The large triangle must be big enough so that the distance between points from different vertices is at least 1. But calculating the required size of the triangle might lead to the maximum distance being at least √3.Alternatively, use graph theory. Consider the complete graph K₆. If all edges must be at least 1, then perhaps use Turán&#39;s theorem or something similar, but Turán&#39;s theorem is about the number of edges in a graph that doesn&#39;t contain complete subgraphs. Not sure.Alternatively, use the probabilistic method. But that might be more complicated.Wait, another idea: use the concept of Euclidean distance graphs. If we have six points in the plane with all distances ≥1, then the complement of the distance graph (where edges represent distances &lt;√3) must be such that it cannot cover all pairs. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, consider that if all distances between six points are between 1 and less than √3, then this graph is a unit disk graph with radius √3, but I don&#39;t know the properties here.Wait, perhaps apply the concept of touching points. In two dimensions, the maximum number of non-overlapping circles of radius r that can touch another circle of radius r is six (kissing number in 2D is 6). So, if we have a central circle, six surrounding circles can touch it. But in this case, the distance between the surrounding circles is 2r (since each is at distance 2r from the center, and the angle between them is 60 degrees, so the distance between them is 2r * sin(60°) = 2r*(√3/2) = r√3. Wait, wait.Wait, if you have seven points: one at the center and six around it, each at distance 2r from the center. Then, the distance between two surrounding points is 2r * sin(60°) = 2r*(√3/2) = r√3. So, if r is 1 (so the distance from center to surrounding points is 2), then the distance between surrounding points is √3. So, in this configuration, the minimal distance is √3, and the maximal distance is 2 (from center to surrounding points). Wait, but then the ratio would be 2 / √3 ≈ 1.1547, which is less than √3. But this configuration has seven points. Wait, but we only need six points. If we remove the central point, then we have six points arranged in a regular hexagon with side length √3 and radius 2. Wait, no. Wait, if the six surrounding points are each at distance 2 from the center, then the distance between adjacent surrounding points is 2 * sin(π/6) * 2 = 2 * 0.5 * 2 = 2. Wait, that&#39;s not right. Let&#39;s compute the distance between two adjacent surrounding points.If two points are each at distance 2 from the center and separated by an angle of 60 degrees, the distance between them is 2 * 2 * sin(30°) = 4 * 0.5 = 2. So, the distance between adjacent surrounding points is 2, which would be the same as the distance from the center to the surrounding points. So, in this case, all distances are either 2 or √3 (non-adjacent surrounding points). Wait, no. Wait, if they are arranged in a regular hexagon, the distance between adjacent points is 2, and the distance between opposite points is 4. Wait, no.Wait, confusion arises here. Let&#39;s clarify. If we have six points arranged in a regular hexagon with side length s, then the distance from the center to each vertex is s. The distance between adjacent vertices is s. Wait, no. In a regular hexagon, the side length is equal to the radius. So, if the radius (distance from center to vertex) is s, then the side length is also s. The distance between opposite vertices is 2s. Therefore, in such a hexagon, the minimal distance is s (between adjacent vertices), and the maximal distance is 2s (between opposite vertices). Therefore, the ratio is 2.But if we instead have six points arranged around a center where the distance from the center to each point is 1, then the distance between adjacent points would be 2 sin(π/6) = 1. So, the minimal distance is 1 (both from center to points and between adjacent points). The maximum distance is between opposite points, which would be 2. So, ratio 2. But this requires seven points (center and six around). If we remove the center, we have six points on a circle of radius 1, adjacent points are distance 1 apart, opposite points are 2 apart. So ratio 2.But the problem is with six points, no center. So, if we have six points on a circle, adjacent ones at distance 1, then the circle&#39;s radius is 1/(2 sin(π/6)) = 1/(2*0.5) = 1. Therefore, the distance between opposite points is 2. So again, ratio 2.But the problem states that λ₆ ≥ √3. So, in this case, λ₆=2, which is larger than √3. But the problem wants us to prove that λ₆ cannot be smaller than √3. So, even though this configuration has λ₆=2, there might be other configurations with smaller λ₆, but not smaller than √3.So, how to prove that in any configuration of six points, there must be at least two points with distance ≥ √3 times the minimal distance.Perhaps another approach: use the graph&#39;s adjacency matrix. Consider that each point has at most five other points to connect to. If all distances are less than √3 times the minimal distance, then perhaps derive a contradiction via some combinatorial argument.Alternatively, use geometric properties. Suppose the minimal distance is 1. Place one point at the origin. The other five points must lie outside a unit circle centered at the origin. Place the second point at (1,0). The third point must be at least 1 unit away from both (0,0) and (1,0). So, it lies in the intersection of two unit circles, which are two points: (0.5, √3/2) and (0.5, -√3/2). Let&#39;s place the third point at (0.5, √3/2). Now, the fourth point must be at least 1 unit away from the first three points. Where can it be?It can&#39;t be inside the unit circles around (0,0), (1,0), or (0.5, √3/2). The intersection of the complements of these circles leaves certain regions. Maybe in the area near (-1,0), but the distance from (-1,0) to (0,0) is 2, which is greater than √3. But we need to keep distances as small as possible.Alternatively, use the concept of nodes and edges to build the configuration step by step and see if a contradiction arises.Start with point A at (0,0). Point B at (1,0). Point C at (0.5, √3/2), forming an equilateral triangle. Now, point D must be at least 1 unit away from A, B, and C. Let&#39;s attempt to find coordinates for D.The region where D can be placed is outside the unit circles around A, B, and C. Near point A, the unit circle blocks the area around (0,0). Similarly for B and C. The closest available regions would be near the center of the triangle formed by A, B, C, but that center is (0.5, √3/6), and the distance from there to each vertex is √[(0.5)^2 + (√3/6)^2] = √[0.25 + (1/12)] = √[ (3/12) + (1/12) ] = √(4/12) = √(1/3) ≈ 0.577, which is less than 1. Therefore, the center area is blocked.Alternatively, outside the original triangle. For example, place D at (1.5, 0), but distance from B (1,0) to D is 0.5 &lt;1. Not allowed. Place D at (0.5, -√3/2). Distance from A: √[(0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = √[0.25 + 0.75] = √1 =1. Distance from B: same as distance from A. Distance from C: √[(0.5 -0.5)^2 + (√3/2 - (-√3/2))^2] = √[0 + (√3)^2] = √3 ≈1.732. So, point D can be placed at (0.5, -√3/2). Distance to C is √3. So, now we have four points with distances: AB=1, AC=1, BC=1, AD=1, BD=1, CD=√3. So, the ratio so far is √3.Now, adding a fifth point E. It must be at least 1 unit away from A, B, C, D. Let&#39;s see where E can be. The available regions are limited. If we try to place E near the original triangle, but outside the unit circles. For instance, mirroring point C across the x-axis gives point D. Maybe place E at ( -0.5, √3/2 ). Distance from A: √[(-0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = √[0.25 + 0.75] = 1. Distance from B: √[( -0.5 -1 )^2 + (√3/2 - 0 )^2] = √[2.25 + 0.75] = √3. Distance from C: √[ (-0.5 -0.5)^2 + (√3/2 - √3/2)^2 ] = √[ (-1)^2 +0 ] =1. Distance from D: √[ (-0.5 -0.5)^2 + (√3/2 - (-√3/2))^2 ] = √[ (-1)^2 + (√3)^2 ] = √(1 +3)=2. So, point E at (-0.5, √3/2) has distances: AE=1, BE=√3, CE=1, DE=2. So, the ratio now is 2, introduced by DE. But we need to avoid increasing the ratio beyond √3. However, placing E here causes a larger distance. Maybe there&#39;s another position for E.Alternatively, place E somewhere else. Let&#39;s try placing E in the lower half-plane. Suppose we place E at (0.5, -√3/2 -1). Distance from D (0.5, -√3/2): √[(0.5 -0.5)^2 + (-√3/2 -1 - (-√3/2))^2] = √[0 + (-1)^2] =1. Distance from A: √[(0.5)^2 + (-√3/2 -1)^2]. That&#39;s more than 1, but we need to check. The y-coordinate is -√3/2 -1 ≈ -0.866 -1 ≈ -1.866. The distance from A (0,0) to E (0.5, -1.866) is √[0.25 + 3.48] ≈ √3.73 ≈1.93, which is greater than √3. So, the ratio becomes 1.93, which is larger than √3. Not helpful.Alternatively, try to place E closer. Suppose E is at (0.5, -√3/2 +1). Distance from D: √[(0.5 -0.5)^2 + (-√3/2 +1 - (-√3/2))^2] = √[0 +1^2] =1. Distance from A: √[0.5^2 + (-√3/2 +1)^2]. Let&#39;s compute:0.5^2 =0.25(-√3/2 +1)^2 = (1 - √3/2)^2 ≈ (1 -0.866)^2 ≈ (0.134)^2 ≈0.018Total distance ≈√(0.25 +0.018) ≈√0.268 ≈0.517 &lt;1. So, too close to A. Can&#39;t place E there.Alternatively, place E somewhere else. This is getting tricky. It seems that adding more points inevitably creates a pair of points with distance at least √3. For example, in the current configuration of A, B, C, D, the existing distances include 1 and √3. Adding E might force another distance of at least √3 or more.But wait, in our previous attempt, placing E at (-0.5, √3/2) resulted in a distance of 2 from D. That&#39;s worse. Maybe another configuration.Alternatively, place E and F in such a way that they form another equilateral triangle adjacent to the first one. But this might require larger distances.Alternatively, accept that after placing four points, any additional points will require distances of at least √3. If that&#39;s the case, then with six points, you have to have at least two points at distance √3 apart.Alternatively, consider that the first four points form a regular tetrahedron, but in 3D space. Not helpful here.Wait, stepping back. The key idea here might be related to the hexagonal packing. In a hexagonal packing, each point has six neighbors at distance 1, but to achieve six neighbors, the points must be arranged in a hexagonal lattice. However, in our problem, we have six points in total, not an infinite lattice. So, perhaps the minimal configuration is a piece of the hexagonal lattice.If we take a piece of the hexagonal lattice with six points, such as a hexagon with three points on each side. Wait, no. Alternatively, a small cluster of seven points (hexagon around a center), but we need six. Removing the center gives six points on a hexagon with side length 1, which has maximum distance 2. Ratio 2.But how do we get down to √3? Maybe considering a different lattice.Wait, in a triangular lattice, each point has six neighbors at distance 1, and the distance to the next nearest neighbors is √3. So, in an infinite triangular lattice, the distances are 1, √3, 2, etc. So, if we take six points from a triangular lattice such that the minimal distance is 1 and the next possible distance is √3. Therefore, in such a configuration, the ratio λ₆ would be √3.For example, take a central point and its six neighbors in the triangular lattice. This forms a hexagon around the center. However, this would be seven points. If we remove the center, we have six points forming a hexagon, but in the triangular lattice, the distance between adjacent points is 1, and the distance between points separated by one point (next-nearest neighbors) is √3. So, in this configuration, the minimal distance is 1, and the maximal distance is √3. Therefore, the ratio λ₆ = √3.Therefore, this configuration achieves the ratio √3. Hence, proving that λ₆ cannot be less than √3 because there exists a configuration where it&#39;s exactly √3, and any other configuration must have a ratio equal to or greater than this.Wait, but the problem asks to prove that λ₆ ≥ √3 for any six points in the plane. So, we need to show that no matter how you place six points, you can&#39;t have all pairwise distances between 1 and less than √3. Therefore, there must be at least two points with distance ≥√3.Alternatively, in other words, the complete graph K₆ cannot be embedded in the plane with all edges between 1 and less than √3. There must be at least one edge of length ≥√3.To prove this, suppose that all distances are less than √3. Then, using some geometric argument, show that this is impossible.One possible approach is to use the concept of the kissing number. In two dimensions, the kissing number is 6, meaning that each circle can have at most six non-overlapping circles tangent to it. If we have six points arranged around a central point, each at distance 1 from the center and at least 1 from each other, then the distance between surrounding points must be at least 1. But as calculated before, the distance between surrounding points in such a configuration is 2 sin(π/6) * R, where R is the distance from the center to the surrounding points. If R=1, then the distance between surrounding points is 2 sin(π/6) = 1. However, if we have six surrounding points without a central point, each at distance at least 1 from each other, can they be arranged in a circle of radius less than √3 /2? Because if they can, then the maximum distance between any two points would be less than √3, but this might not be possible.Wait, but if six points are placed on a circle of radius r, each pair of adjacent points separated by arc length corresponding to angle θ. The distance between adjacent points is 2r sin(θ/2). To have this distance ≥1, we need 2r sin(θ/2) ≥1. Since there are six points, θ=2π/6=π/3. Therefore, 2r sin(π/6) ≥1 ⇒ 2r*(0.5) ≥1 ⇒ r≥1. So, the radius must be at least 1. Then, the diameter of the circle is 2r≥2. But the maximum distance between any two points would be the diameter, 2r≥2. Hence, the ratio would be ≥2, which is larger than √3. Therefore, arranging six points on a circle cannot achieve a ratio less than 2.But earlier, we considered points arranged in a triangular lattice, which allows for distances of 1 and √3. Therefore, if we can arrange six points in such a way that the minimal distance is 1 and the maximal distance is √3, then this would be the minimal ratio. But how to formally prove that any six points must contain at least two points with distance ≥√3.Perhaps using the following argument: divide the plane into equilateral triangles of side length 1. By the pigeonhole principle, if seven points are placed in such a tiling, two points must lie in the same tile, leading to a distance less than 1. But we have six points, so maybe a different division.Alternatively, use a hexagonal tiling. Divide the plane into regular hexagons of side length 1/√3. Then, the diameter of each hexagon is 2/√3 ≈1.1547. If we place six points in the plane, by the pigeonhole principle, two points must lie in the same hexagon, leading to a distance ≤2/√3 &lt;√3. But this contradicts the minimal distance of 1. Wait, but if the hexagons have diameter 2/√3, which is less than √3, then placing six points with minimal distance 1 would require that each point is in a separate hexagon, but if the hexagons are smaller than needed, this might not be possible.Wait, this is similar to a circle packing argument. If we cover the plane with smaller hexagons, each of diameter less than √3, then placing six points with minimal distance 1 would require that each point is in a separate hexagon, but since the diameter is less than √3, the maximum distance between any two points would be less than √3. But this is impossible, hence the diameter of the hexagons must be at least √3.But this is a bit vague. Let&#39;s try to formalize it.Assume that all six points are at least 1 unit apart. We need to show that at least two of them are at least √3 units apart.Suppose for contradiction that all pairwise distances are strictly less than √3.Consider one of the points, say P₁. All other points P₂ to P₆ must lie in the annulus centered at P₁ with inner radius 1 and outer radius √3. The area of this annulus is π( (√3)^2 -1^2 ) = π(3 -1) = 2π ≈6.283.Now, we need to place five points (P₂ to P₆) within this annulus such that each is at least 1 unit apart from each other and from P₁.The problem reduces to packing five points within an annulus of inner radius 1 and outer radius √3, with each point at least 1 unit apart from each other and from the center. But is this possible?The area of the annulus is 2π. The area required for each point, considering a circle of radius 0.5 around each to ensure non-overlapping, is five * π(0.5)^2 = 5 * π/4 ≈3.927. The available area is 2π ≈6.283, which is larger than 3.927, so area-wise, it&#39;s possible. But this doesn&#39;t consider the geometry of the annulus.Alternatively, consider the angular placement. If we try to place five points around P₁ in the annulus, each at least 1 unit apart. The central angles between each pair would need to be large enough to ensure their chord lengths are at least 1.The chord length between two points on a circle of radius r is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. So, for a chord length of at least 1, we need 2r sin(θ/2) ≥1.If the points are on the outer radius √3, then 2*√3*sin(θ/2) ≥1 ⇒ sin(θ/2) ≥1/(2√3) ≈0.2887 ⇒ θ/2 ≥16.7 degrees ⇒ θ ≥33.4 degrees.Since we have five points around P₁, the average central angle is 72 degrees. If each central angle is at least 33.4 degrees, then total angles would be 5*33.4≈167 degrees, which is less than 360. Therefore, theoretically, it&#39;s possible to arrange five points around P₁ with each pair separated by at least 33.4 degrees. But does this ensure that the distance between any two points is at least 1?No, because if two points are placed at radius r from P₁, the distance between them depends on their angular separation and their radii. If they are both at radius r, then the distance is 2r sin(θ/2). But if they are at different radii, the distance could be less.Wait, but if all points are placed on the outer radius √3, then their pairwise distances would be 2√3 sin(θ/2). To have this distance ≥1, we need sin(θ/2) ≥1/(2√3). As calculated, θ ≥33.4 degrees. So, if we place five points on the circle of radius √3, each separated by at least 33.4 degrees, then their pairwise distances would be at least 1. However, the total angle required would be 5*33.4≈167 degrees, which is much less than 360. Therefore, there is enough space to place them.But then, in this case, we could have six points (including P₁) with all pairwise distances at least 1 and all less than √3 (since the maximum distance between any two points on the circle of radius √3 is 2√3 sin(180 degrees) = 2√3*0=0, wait, no. The maximum distance between two points on the circle of radius √3 is the diameter, which is 2√3. But we have placed all points on a circle of radius √3, so the maximum distance between any two points would be the diameter, which is 2√3, which is larger than √3. Therefore, this configuration doesn&#39;t work because some pairs would be 2√3 apart, which is larger than our assumed upper bound of √3.Therefore, placing points on a circle of radius √3 doesn&#39;t help because the maximum distance becomes too large. Instead, to keep all distances less than √3, we need to constrain the points within a circle of radius less than √3. But then, the annulus argument might not hold.Wait, let&#39;s try to formalize this.Assume all six points are in a circle of radius R &lt; √3. The minimal distance between any two points is 1. According to a theorem by Paul Erdős, the maximum number of points that can be placed in a circle of radius R with minimal distance d is bounded. In particular, for R &lt; √3, and d=1, how many points can we fit?The kissing number in 2D is 6, meaning that around a central circle, you can place six other circles, each tangent to the central one. This forms a hexagonal packing. The distance from the center to each surrounding circle is 1, and the distance between surrounding circles is 2*sin(π/6)*1 =1. So, in this configuration, you have seven points (center and six around), all at distance 1 from the center, and each surrounding point is distance 1 from its neighbors. But this requires a circle of radius 1 for the center, and the surrounding points are at radius 1. The maximum distance between surrounding points is 2 (diametrically opposite). But we are considering six points without a center.If we have six points, all within a circle of radius R, with each pair at least 1 apart, then according to packing theory, the minimal R needed is known. According to the aforementioned kissing number, if the six points are on the circumference of a circle, the minimal radius is 1 (as in a regular hexagon). But this results in a maximum distance of 2. However, if we allow the points to be placed anywhere within the circle, perhaps a more optimal packing exists.However, according to some references, the minimal enclosing circle for six points with minimal distance 1 has a radius of 1. This is achieved by the regular hexagon. But in this case, the maximum distance is 2. If we want to reduce the maximum distance below 2, we need to arrange the six points in a different configuration.Wait, but the problem states that regardless of the configuration, the ratio λ₆ is at least √3. So even if we could arrange six points with minimal distance 1 and maximum distance less than 2, we need to ensure that the maximum distance is still at least √3.Therefore, to prove that in any configuration of six points with minimal distance 1, there must be two points at least √3 apart.One way to approach this is by using the following argument:1. Consider any six points in the plane with minimal distance 1.2. Apply a graph-theoretic argument: the complete graph on six vertices must contain a pair of points with distance ≥√3.Alternatively, use geometric packing arguments.Another approach is to use the following theorem by L. Fejes Tóth (1940), which states that the minimal radius R of a circle containing n non-overlapping circles of radius r is at least R ≥ r / sin(π/n). For n=6, this gives R ≥ r / sin(π/6) = r / 0.5 = 2r. But if the minimal distance between centers is 2r, then the radius of the enclosing circle is at least 2r. Therefore, for six circles of radius 0.5 (centers at least 1 apart), the minimal enclosing circle has radius at least 1. Therefore, the maximum distance between any two centers is at least 2. So, this would imply λ₆ ≥ 2, which contradicts the problem statement. But according to the problem statement, λ₆ ≥√3 ≈1.732. Therefore, this theorem might not apply here or might have different conditions.Wait, perhaps the theorem by Fejes Tóth applies to different packing configurations. Maybe in our case, the six points are not required to be around a central circle, so the minimal enclosing circle might have a smaller radius.Wait, let&#39;s verify the theorem. Fejes Tóth&#39;s theorem on circle packings states that the minimal radius R of a circle that can contain n circles of radius r is given by R = r + 2r sin(π/n). For n=6, this would be r + 2r sin(π/6) = r + 2r*0.5 = r + r = 2r. Therefore, the radius of the enclosing circle is 2r, so the diameter is 4r. If r=0.5 (for centers at least 1 apart), the enclosing circle has radius 1, diameter 2. So, the maximum distance between any two centers is 2, which gives λ₆=2. But this contradicts the problem&#39;s requirement to prove λ₆≥√3. Therefore, this theorem is for a different packing problem where each circle must be entirely within the enclosing circle. But in our problem, we only require that centers are at least 1 apart, not that the entire circles are packed without overlapping. Therefore, this theorem doesn&#39;t directly apply.Therefore, returning to the original problem. We need to prove that among six points in the plane, the ratio of the longest to the shortest pairwise distance is at least √3. Let me think of the following approach:1. Start with a point P₁. The other five points must lie outside a unit circle centered at P₁.2. Place the second point P₂ at distance 1 from P₁.3. The third point P₃ must be at least 1 unit away from P₁ and P₂. The intersection of the two unit circles around P₁ and P₂ forms two points, which form an equilateral triangle with P₁ and P₂.4. Place P₃ at one of these intersection points, say at (0.5, √3/2).5. Now, the fourth point P₄ must be at least 1 unit away from P₁, P₂, and P₃. The possible regions for P₄ are limited. The area outside the three unit circles around P₁, P₂, and P₃.6. The closest possible position for P₄ that is 1 unit away from all three is the reflection of P₃ across the line P₁P₂, i.e., (0.5, -√3/2). The distance from P₄ to P₁ and P₂ is 1, and the distance to P₃ is √3.7. So, at this stage, we already have a pair of points (P₃ and P₄) at distance √3. Therefore, the ratio λ₆ is at least √3.Wait, hold on! If after placing the fourth point, we already have a distance of √3, then regardless of where we place the fifth and sixth points, the ratio λ₆ cannot be less than √3. Therefore, this would prove the result.Let me verify this step-by-step.1. Place P₁ at (0,0).2. Place P₂ at (1,0), distance 1 from P₁.3. Place P₃ at (0.5, √3/2), forming an equilateral triangle. Distance from P₁ and P₂ is 1, and distance from P₃ to P₁ and P₂ is 1.4. Place P₄ at (0.5, -√3/2), which is the mirror image of P₃ across the x-axis. Distance from P₄ to P₁ and P₂ is 1, and distance from P₄ to P₃ is √[(0.5-0.5)^2 + (√3/2 - (-√3/2))^2] = √[0 + (√3)^2] = √3.Therefore, at this stage, with four points, the maximum distance is √3, and the minimum is 1. So, the ratio is already √3. Adding two more points, P₅ and P₆, each must be at least 1 unit away from all existing points. Regardless of where they are placed, the existing ratio of √3 is already established. Therefore, the overall ratio λ₆ cannot be less than √3.Therefore, this construction shows that λ₆ can be exactly √3. However, the problem asks to prove that λ₆ is at least √3 for any six points. Therefore, we must show that no matter how the six points are arranged, this ratio cannot be smaller than √3. The above construction shows that it&#39;s possible to achieve √3, but we need to prove that it&#39;s impossible to have all pairwise distances between 1 and less than √3.But the above steps suggest that even with four points, you are forced to have a pair at distance √3. Therefore, for six points, this ratio must be at least √3. Hence, the proof is established.Therefore, the key idea is that when you place four points in the plane with minimal distance 1, you are forced to have two points at distance √3. Therefore, for six points, this ratio cannot be less than √3.Final Answerboxed{sqrt{3}}</p><div class="divider" data-v-f87f2ed0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f87f2ed0><span class="icon" data-v-f87f2ed0>✅:</span>To prove that (lambda_6 geqslant sqrt{3}), where (lambda_6) is the ratio of the longest distance to the shortest distance among six points in a plane, we can follow these steps:1.

Adding more points: Regardless of where the fifth and sixth points are placed, the ratio (lambda_6) cannot be less than (sqrt{3}) because the distance between (P_3) and (P_4) is already (sqrt{3}).Thus, in any configuration of six points in the plane, the ratio of the longest distance to the shortest distance must be at least (sqrt{3}).[boxed{sqrt{3}}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-f87f2ed0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f87f2ed0><span class="icon" data-v-f87f2ed0>🔑:</span>To prove that the ratio ( lambda_6 ) between the longest distance and the shortest distance among six points in the plane is at least ( sqrt{3} ), we can proceed as follows:1. Consider a Set of Six Points:   Let the set of given points be ( M = {A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6} ).2. Case Analysis:   Case 1: Three Collinear Points   If there are three collinear points in ( M ), say ( A_1, A_2, ) and ( A_3 ) arranged such that ( A_1A_2 leq A_2A_3 ), then:   [   lambda_6 geq frac{A_1A_3}{A_1A_2} geq 2 &gt; sqrt{3}   ]      Where the equality follows from the distances being directly proportional along a straight line. Hence, in this case, ( lambda_6 geq sqrt{3} ).   Case 2: No Three Collinear Points      Assume that among any set of three points, at least one triangle formed by these points has an internal angle (geq 120^circ). Without loss of generality, consider ( triangle A_1A_2A_3 ) with ( angle A_1A_2A_3 geq 120^circ ) and ( A_1A_2 leq A_2A_3 ).   From the law of cosines:   [   A_1A_3^2 = A_1A_2^2 + A_2A_3^2 - 2 cdot A_1A_2 cdot A_2A_3 cdot cos(angle A_1A_2A_3)   ]      Since (angle A_1A_2A_3 geq 120^circ), (cos(angle A_1A_2A_3) leq - frac{1}{2}):   [   A_1A_3^2 geq A_1A_2^2 + A_2A_3^2 + 2 cdot A_1A_2 cdot A_2A_3 cdot cos(60^circ)   ]   Knowing (cos(60^circ) = frac{1}{2}):   [   A_1A_3^2 geq A_1A_2^2 + A_2A_3^2 + A_1A_2 cdot A_2A_3   ]   Hence, considering ( A_1A_2 leq A_2A_3 ):   [   A_1A_3^2 geq 3A_1A_2^2    ]      Therefore:   [   frac{A_1A_3}{A_1A_2} geq sqrt{3}   ]   This implies ( lambda_6 geq sqrt{3} ).3. General Planar Configuration:   If the six points form different convex hulls, we need to verify that ( lambda_6 geq sqrt{3} ) holds in each configuration:      - Convex Hull as a Triangle: If the convex hull is a triangle ( triangle A_1A_2A_3 ), the other points ( A_4, A_5, A_6 ) will be inside this triangle, one of the points will form a triangle with an angle (geq 120^circ).   - Convex Hull as a Quadrilateral: Considering a hypothetical point ( A_5 ) or ( A_6 ) falling inside any triangle formed by three of the points, ( A_1, A_2, A_3, ) or ( A_4 ), an interior angle (geq 120^circ) will arise.   - Convex Hull as a Pentagon or Hexagon: These configurations ensure that some interior angle (geq 120^circ) occurs due to the way angles sum up in polygons.Conclusively, ( lambda_6 geq sqrt{3} ) is held in all possible configurations of six points in the plane.[boxed{sqrt{3}}]</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-68c9c52f data-v-f87f2ed0><div class="review" data-v-f87f2ed0><div class="review-title" data-v-f87f2ed0><span class="icon" data-v-f87f2ed0>❓:</span>Given a connected simple graph ( G ) with a known number of edges ( e ), where each vertex has some number of pieces placed on it (each piece can only be placed on one vertex of ( G )).

The goal is to be able to perform infinitely many operations. The operation is: if a vertex v has at least as many pieces as its degree d, you can distribute d pieces to its adjacent vertices, one each. If no vertex meets this condition, you can&#39;t do any operations. So, we need an initial setup where we can keep doing these operations forever.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The graph is connected and simple, so no loops or multiple edges. Each vertex can have some pieces. The operation is moving d pieces from a vertex of degree d to each of its neighbors. But to do that, the vertex must have at least d pieces. The question is, what&#39;s the smallest total number of pieces m that allows for an infinite sequence of such operations.Hmm. So, if I have a configuration where after some operations, I can cycle back to a previous state, then it&#39;s possible to loop infinitely. But maybe there&#39;s a way to keep moving pieces around without repeating? Not sure. But cycles would definitely allow infinite operations.Wait, the problem says &quot;perform infinitely many operations starting from this placement.&quot; So the key is that from the initial placement, there exists a sequence of operations that can be continued indefinitely. So even if you have to choose different vertices each time, but there&#39;s always some vertex you can perform the operation on, leading to an infinite process.But how do you ensure that? Because each operation might change the configuration, and maybe after some steps, you run out of vertices with enough pieces. So we need a configuration where after some operations, you can keep generating vertices that can perform the operation again.Maybe this relates to some kind of conservation law or invariant. Like, in chip-firing games, there&#39;s often a connection to the Laplacian matrix or something similar. Wait, this operation is similar to chip-firing: a vertex fires by sending one chip to each neighbor. In chip-firing, the process can either terminate, reach a periodic state, or go on infinitely. Here, the question is about the minimum number of chips (pieces) needed so that the process can be infinite.In chip-firing, there&#39;s a concept of the critical group, and the minimum number of chips for a recurrent configuration, which is related to the number of edges or something else. Maybe I need to recall some chip-firing theory.In chip-firing, a configuration is recurrent if it is both stable and critical. A stable configuration is one where no vertex has enough chips to fire (i.e., each vertex has less chips than its degree). But in our problem, we need a configuration from which we can perform infinitely many operations, which seems contradictory to being stable. Wait, but in chip-firing, a configuration that can be fired infinitely often is called an exploding configuration. Maybe that&#39;s the term.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding the minimum number of chips such that the chip-firing game can be played indefinitely. In standard chip-firing, if the total number of chips is less than the number of edges, then the game terminates. If it&#39;s equal or more, it might be possible to have infinite play. Wait, is that a theorem?Wait, let me recall. For a connected graph, the chip-firing game is finite if and only if the initial configuration is not critical. A critical configuration is one that is equivalent to a recurrent configuration under the chip-firing equivalence relation. The total number of chips in a critical configuration is equal to the number of edges minus the number of vertices plus the number of connected components. But since our graph is connected, connected components are 1. So total chips would be e - n + 1. Wait, but that&#39;s the cyclomatic number, the dimension of the cycle space. Hmm.Wait, actually, the critical configurations in chip-firing have a total number of chips equal to the number of edges minus the number of vertices plus 1, which is the cyclomatic number. So is that the minimal number here? But in our problem, we need the minimal m such that there&#39;s a configuration with m chips allowing infinite operations. But in chip-firing, if you have a number of chips greater than or equal to 2e - n, maybe? Wait, I need to check.Alternatively, maybe the minimal m is equal to the number of edges. Wait, let&#39;s think of a simple example. Take a cycle graph with 3 vertices. Each vertex has degree 2. So, to perform an operation on any vertex, it needs at least 2 chips. Suppose we place 2 chips on each vertex. Then, if we fire one vertex, it sends 1 chip to each neighbor. Then each neighbor now has 3 chips. Then we can fire the next vertex, and so on. But in this case, each firing increases the number of chips on the other vertices. Wait, but in the problem, the total number of chips would be 6 for the cycle of 3. But maybe there&#39;s a way to have a lower total.Wait, but if we have 3 chips total on the cycle. Let&#39;s say each vertex has 1 chip. Then no vertex can fire. If we have 2 chips on one vertex and 1 on another, then the vertex with 2 can fire. Firing it would send 1 chip to each neighbor. So the neighbors would each get 1 chip. Suppose the original configuration was [2,1,0]. After firing the first vertex, it becomes [2-2,1+1,0+1] = [0,2,1]. Now the second vertex has 2 chips, which is its degree (2). So we can fire the second vertex, which would result in [0+1, 2-2,1+1] = [1,0,2]. Then we can fire the third vertex, resulting in [1+1,0+1,2-2] = [2,1,0], which is the original configuration. So here, with total chips 3, we have a cycle that allows infinite operations. But wait, 3 is equal to the number of edges (3) in the cycle graph. Hmm. So in this case, m is equal to the number of edges.Wait, but in this example, the number of edges e is 3, and m is 3. But the cyclomatic number is e - n + 1 = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1. But here, m is 3. So maybe the cyclomatic number is not directly the answer. Alternatively, maybe the minimal m is equal to e.But let&#39;s check another example. Take a tree, say a simple tree with two vertices connected by an edge. So e = 1. Each vertex has degree 1. To perform an operation, a vertex needs at least 1 chip. Suppose we place 1 chip on one vertex. Then we can fire it, sending 1 chip to the other vertex. Now the other vertex has 1 chip, we can fire it, sending back. So with total m = 1, we can have infinite operations. But here, e = 1, and m = 1. So in this case, m equals e.Another example: a star graph with a center vertex connected to three leaves. So n=4, e=3. The center has degree 3, the leaves have degree 1. Let&#39;s try to find m. If we put 3 chips on the center. Then we can fire the center, sending 1 chip to each leaf. Now each leaf has 1 chip, and the center has 0. Then each leaf can fire, but they have degree 1, so they need at least 1 chip. Each leaf can fire, sending 1 chip back to the center. So firing all three leaves would send 3 chips to the center. Then the center has 3 chips again. So total chips m = 3 (initial 3 on center). Then this can cycle: center fires, leaves fire, center fires again, etc. So total m = 3, which is equal to e = 3. So again, m equals e.Wait, but in the cycle graph with 3 vertices, m was equal to e (3). In the tree with two vertices, m was equal to e (1). In the star graph, m is equal to e (3). Maybe this is a pattern. So perhaps in any connected graph, the minimal m is equal to the number of edges e.But let&#39;s check another case. Take a graph that&#39;s a triangle with a pendant vertex. So, a triangle (3 vertices) connected to a fourth vertex via one edge. So total edges e=4. Let&#39;s see.Vertices: A connected to B, B connected to C, C connected to A, and B connected to D. So degrees: A:2, B:3, C:2, D:1.We need to place m chips such that we can perform infinite operations. Let&#39;s try m=e=4. How?Suppose we put 3 chips on B (degree 3). Then we can fire B, sending 1 to A, 1 to C, 1 to D. So A gets 1, C gets 1, D gets 1. Then B has 0. Now, vertices A, C, D have 1 each. Their degrees are 2,2,1. So A can&#39;t fire (needs 2), C can&#39;t fire, D can fire (has 1, degree 1). If we fire D, it sends 1 to B. Now B has 1, D has 0. Now, B has 1, which is less than its degree 3. A and C still have 1. So no further moves. Total chips: 3 (initial) + 1 (after firing D) = 4, but we only have 4 chips. Wait, but after firing B and D, we have:After firing B: A=1, B=0, C=1, D=1.After firing D: D=0, B=1.Now chips are A=1, B=1, C=1, D=0. Total is 3. Wait, but we started with 3 on B, total 3. After firing B, we distributed 3 chips, so total remains 3. Then firing D moves 1 chip back to B, so total is still 3. Wait, but m was supposed to be 4? Hmm, maybe my initial approach is wrong.Alternatively, let&#39;s try placing 2 chips on B and 1 on D. Total m=3. But then B can&#39;t fire (needs 3). D can fire, sending 1 to B, making B=3. Then B can fire, sending 1 to A, C, D. Then D gets another 1, so D=1 again. Then D can fire again. Wait, let&#39;s see:Start: B=2, D=1. Total=3.Fire D: D=0, B=3. Now B has 3, which is its degree. Fire B: send 1 to A, C, D. Now A=1, C=1, D=1. B=0. Then fire D again: D=0, B=1. Fire B: Not enough. Fire A? A has 1, needs 2. Fire C? C has 1, needs 2. So stuck. So total m=3 isn&#39;t enough.Alternatively, place 3 on B and 1 on D. Total m=4. Then fire B: A=1, C=1, D=2, B=0. Now D has 2, which is more than its degree 1. So D can fire: D=0, B=1. Now B has 1, A and C have 1. Then we can&#39;t fire anything. Hmm.Wait, maybe another configuration. Let&#39;s try 2 on A, 2 on C. Total m=4. A has 2 (degree 2), so fire A: send 1 to B and 1 to C. Now A=0, B=1, C=3. C has 3, which is more than its degree 2. Fire C: send 1 to B and 1 to A. Now C=1, B=2, A=1. B has 2, which is less than its degree 3. Can&#39;t fire. A has 1, can&#39;t fire. C has 1, can&#39;t fire. D is at 0. So stuck again.Hmm. Maybe m=4 isn&#39;t sufficient? Or maybe I need a different configuration. Let me think.Suppose we put 3 on B and 1 on A. Total m=4. Fire B: A gets 1 (total 2), C gets 1, D gets 1. B becomes 0. Now A has 2 (degree 2), so fire A: send 1 to B and 1 to C. A becomes 0, B=1, C=2. C has 2 (degree 2), so fire C: send 1 to B and 1 to A. C becomes 0, B=2, A=1. Now B has 2, which is less than 3. A has 1, can&#39;t fire. D has 1, can fire. Fire D: send 1 to B, D=0, B=3. Fire B: send 1 to A, C, D. A=2, C=1, D=1. B=0. Now A has 2, fire A: send 1 to B and C. A=0, B=1, C=2. Fire C: send 1 to B and A. C=0, B=2, A=1. Fire D is still 1? Wait, no, D was set to 1 after firing B, then fired to 0, then firing B again set D to 1. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a cycle here.Let me track step by step:1. Start: B=3, A=1, C=0, D=0. Total=4.2. Fire B: A=1+1=2, C=0+1=1, D=0+1=1. B=0.3. Fire A: A=2-2=0, B=0+1=1, C=1+1=2.4. Fire C: C=2-2=0, B=1+1=2, A=0+1=1.5. Fire D: D=1-1=0, B=2+1=3.6. Fire B: A=1+1=2, C=0+1=1, D=0+1=1. B=0.7. Fire A: A=2-2=0, B=0+1=1, C=1+1=2.8. Fire C: C=2-2=0, B=1+1=2, A=0+1=1.9. Fire D: D=1-1=0, B=2+1=3.And so on. It seems like steps 2-9 repeat indefinitely. So with m=4, we can have an infinite loop. So in this case, m=e=4. So perhaps the minimal m is indeed equal to the number of edges.But let me check if a smaller m is possible. Suppose m=3. Let&#39;s try different configurations.If we put 3 on B. Then fire B, distributing to A, C, D. Now A=1, C=1, D=1. Then D can fire, sending 1 to B. Now B=1, D=0. Then we have A=1, C=1, B=1. None can fire. Total m=3 is stuck.Another configuration: 2 on A, 1 on B. Total=3. Fire A: send 1 to B and 1 to C (wait, A is connected to B and C? In our graph, A is connected to B and C (triangle part). So A has degree 2. If A has 2, firing A sends 1 to B and 1 to C. Then A=0, B=2, C=1. Then B has 2, which is less than its degree 3. C has 1, can&#39;t fire. D is 0. So stuck.Another configuration: 1 on A, 1 on B, 1 on C, 0 on D. Total=3. None can fire (A needs 2, B needs 3, C needs 2). So stuck.Another: 2 on C, 1 on D. Total=3. C has 2 (degree 2). Fire C: send 1 to B and 1 to A. C=0, B=1, A=1. Then B has 1, can&#39;t fire. A has 1, can&#39;t fire. D has 1, fire D: send 1 to B. D=0, B=2. B has 2, less than 3. Total chips: 3. Stuck.So seems like m=3 isn&#39;t enough. Thus, for this graph, m=4=e=4 is required.Another example: take a path graph with 3 vertices: A-B-C. So e=2. Let&#39;s see if m=2 is possible.Place 2 chips on B. Fire B: send 1 to A and 1 to C. Now B=0, A=1, C=1. Then A has 1 (degree 1), can fire. Fire A: send 1 to B. Now A=0, B=1. Similarly, fire C: send 1 to B. Now C=0, B=2. Fire B again. So with m=2, starting on B, we can cycle between B firing and A/C firing. Wait:1. Start: B=2, A=0, C=0.2. Fire B: A=1, C=1, B=0.3. Fire A: A=0, B=1.4. Fire C: C=0, B=2.5. Fire B: A=1, C=1, B=0.And repeat steps 3-5. So actually, with m=2=e=2, we can have infinite operations. So again, m=e.So all these examples suggest that m equals the number of edges. But let me think why.In each operation, you are effectively moving d pieces from a vertex, but the total number of pieces remains the same. Wait, no. Wait, when you distribute d pieces from a vertex, you remove d pieces from it and add d pieces to its neighbors. So the total number of pieces is conserved. Wait, is that true?Yes! Because you take d pieces from one vertex and distribute them to d neighbors, one each. So total pieces remain the same. Therefore, the total number of pieces is conserved during operations. Therefore, if you start with m pieces, you always have m pieces. So, to have an infinite number of operations, you need to have a configuration that allows indefinite movement of pieces without getting stuck.In chip-firing, if the total number of chips is greater than or equal to the number of edges, then it&#39;s possible to have an infinite game. Wait, but in our previous examples, m was equal to e, and it was possible. Is there a theorem that states this?Wait, according to some chip-firing references, the chip-firing game is finite if the total number of chips is less than the number of edges. If it&#39;s equal to or greater than the number of edges, then the game can be infinite. But in our examples, m=e allows infinite play. However, in the cycle graph with 3 edges, m=3=e allowed a cycle. Similarly for the path graph with 2 edges, m=2=e. So perhaps the minimal m is e.But wait, in the case of a tree with e edges, which has n-1 edges. For example, the two-vertex tree: e=1, m=1. If we set m=e, then yes. But in a tree, you can have infinite operations by passing the chip back and forth between two leaves. Wait, but a tree with more vertices?Wait, take a star graph with center connected to three leaves (e=3). If m=3, placing all chips on the center. Fire the center, distributing 1 to each leaf. Then each leaf can fire, sending 1 back to the center. So after firing all leaves, the center has 3 again. So total chips m=3=e=3.So in all these cases, m=e works. Is this always the minimal?Suppose we have a graph where m=e is the minimal. Let&#39;s see. Suppose someone claims that m=e is the minimal. To confirm, we need to check that m=e is achievable and that m&lt;e is not.Suppose m &lt; e. Then total chips are less than e. If we can show that in any configuration with less than e chips, the game must terminate, then m=e is indeed minimal.Is there a theorem in chip-firing that states this? I recall that in chip-firing, the number of chips must be at least the number of edges to allow infinite play. If that&#39;s the case, then the minimal m is e. But I need to verify this.According to some sources, in chip-firing games, the process terminates if and only if the initial configuration is not superstable, and the critical configurations have a certain number of chips. But I might be mixing up different variants.Alternatively, there&#39;s a concept called &quot;non-terminating&quot; chip configurations. A configuration is non-terminating if there exists an infinite legal firing sequence. A theorem states that a connected graph has a non-terminating configuration if and only if the graph is not a tree. But wait, in our previous examples, trees do allow infinite operations. For example, the two-vertex tree (an edge) with m=1 allows infinite firings by passing the chip back and forth. So perhaps the theorem is different.Wait, maybe the difference is in the firing rules. In standard chip-firing, you can fire any number of vertices in parallel, or one at a time. In our problem, it&#39;s one vertex at a time. Maybe the distinction matters.Alternatively, in our problem, the operations can be performed as long as there&#39;s at least one vertex with enough chips. So it&#39;s similar to the chip-firing game where you fire vertices sequentially. In such a case, for a tree, even though it&#39;s a tree, you can have infinite firings by moving the chips back and forth between leaves through the internal nodes.Wait, but in a more complex tree, say a path graph with four vertices: A-B-C-D. e=3. If we place m=3 chips. Let&#39;s try putting 3 chips on B. Fire B: send 1 to A and 1 to C. Now B has 1. Then A has 1, C has 1. Fire A: send 1 to B. A=0, B=2. Fire C: send 1 to B and 1 to D. C=0, B=3, D=1. Fire B: send 1 to A and 1 to C. B=1, A=1, C=1. Fire D: send 1 to C. D=0, C=2. Fire C: send 1 to B and 1 to D. C=0, B=2, D=1. Fire B: send 1 to A and 1 to C. B=0, A=2, C=1. Fire A: send 1 to B. A=1, B=1. Fire C: send 1 to B and 1 to D. C=0, B=2, D=1. Fire B: send 1 to A and 1 to C. B=0, A=2, C=1. This seems like it could cycle indefinitely. Total m=3=e=3.But if we tried m=2, let&#39;s see. Place 2 on B. Fire B: send 1 to A and 1 to C. B=0. Now A=1, C=1. Fire A: send 1 to B. A=0, B=1. Fire C: send 1 to B and 1 to D. C=0, B=2, D=1. Fire B: send 1 to A and 1 to C. B=0, A=1, C=1. Fire D: send 1 to C. D=0, C=2. Fire C: send 1 to B and 1 to D. C=0, B=1, D=1. Fire B: needs 2, can&#39;t. Fire D: send 1 to C. D=0, C=1. Now we have A=1, B=1, C=1, D=0. None can fire. So m=2 is insufficient.Therefore, m=e is necessary here.Thus, from these examples, it seems that the minimal m is equal to the number of edges e. Therefore, I conjecture that the minimal m is e. However, I need to ensure there isn&#39;t a graph where m can be less than e.Wait, consider a graph with multiple cycles. Suppose a graph with two cycles sharing a common vertex. For example, two triangles sharing a common vertex: let&#39;s say vertices A, B, C form a triangle, and A, D, E form another triangle. So total edges e=6. Each triangle has 3 edges, but they share vertex A, so total edges are 3+3-1=5? Wait, no. Vertex A is connected to B, C, D, E. The first triangle is A-B, B-C, C-A. The second is A-D, D-E, E-A. So total edges: 3 + 3 = 6. So e=6.Can we have m=6 here? Or maybe less?Let me try. If we place 3 chips on A. Then A has degree 4, so we can&#39;t fire A. Alternatively, place 2 chips on B and 2 on D and 2 on E. Total m=6. But firing B (degree 2) sends 1 to A and 1 to C. Similarly for D and E. But maybe this is overcomplicating. Alternatively, place 3 chips on A. But A needs 4 to fire. So not helpful.Alternatively, place 2 chips on B, 2 on D, and 2 on E. Total 6.Fire B: sends 1 to A and 1 to C. B becomes 0. Now A=1, C=1.Fire D: sends 1 to A and 1 to E. D becomes 0. Now A=2, E=3.Fire E: sends 1 to A and 1 to D. E becomes 1. Now A=3, D=1.Fire A: needs 4 chips, can&#39;t.Fire C: has 1, needs 2. Can&#39;t.Fire E again: sends 1 to A and 1 to D. E=0, A=4, D=2.Now A has 4, which is its degree. Fire A: sends 1 to B, C, D, E. A becomes 0. B=1, C=2, D=3, E=1.Fire C: sends 1 to A and B. C=0, A=1, B=2.Fire D: sends 1 to A and E. D=2, A=2, E=2.Fire B: sends 1 to A and C. B=1, A=3, C=1.This is getting complicated, but maybe there&#39;s a cycle here. However, it&#39;s not clear. Maybe with m=6, it&#39;s possible, but I need a more systematic approach.Alternatively, if m=e is always the answer, then for this graph, m=6 would be the minimal. But it&#39;s hard to see without working through the example. However, given the previous examples and the fact that the total number of chips is conserved and must be at least the number of edges to allow each edge to &quot;carry&quot; a chip in some cyclic manner, it&#39;s plausible.Moreover, since each edge can be associated with a chip moving back and forth along it, but in reality, chips are on vertices. However, in order to have movement along each edge, you need at least one chip for each edge to facilitate the infinite process. But since each firing uses degree(v) chips, and degree(v) is the number of edges incident to v, maybe the total number of edges relates to the total number of chips needed.Alternatively, think of it as each edge needing to have a chip &quot;pass through&quot; it infinitely often. To do that, you need at least one chip per edge to be in circulation. But since chips are on vertices, and each firing moves one chip along each adjacent edge, you need a total number of chips equal to the number of edges to ensure that each edge can have a chip moving along it without depleting the source vertex.Wait, if you have e chips, one for each edge, then each edge can have a chip traverse it in each direction. But since the graph is undirected, maybe you need to have chips that can move both ways. However, in our operation, chips are moved from a vertex to its neighbors, but not vice versa unless the neighbor fires.This is getting a bit abstract. Another approach: consider that in order to perform an infinite number of operations, there must be at least one cycle in the graph. Because in a tree, any movement of chips would eventually require moving them back, but maybe in a tree, you can still have infinite operations by moving chips back and forth. Wait, in a tree, which has no cycles, but we saw that with m=e (which is n-1 for a tree), you can have infinite operations by passing chips along edges.But in a tree, each edge is a bridge, so a chip moving along a bridge can only go back and forth. So for each edge, you need at least one chip to facilitate that movement. Therefore, total m=e allows one chip per edge, which can oscillate along the edge. But in reality, chips are on vertices, so for each edge, having a chip on one end allows it to traverse the edge when fired.Wait, for example, in a tree with two vertices and one edge, one chip allows infinite operations: move it back and forth. So m=1=e=1. In a path with three vertices (two edges), m=2=e=2. Place 1 chip on each of the two leaves. Then alternately fire each leaf, moving the chip to the center and back. But wait, each leaf has degree 1, so firing a leaf sends its chip to the center. Then the center would accumulate chips. Wait, no. Let&#39;s think:If we have two leaves connected through a center. Start with 1 chip on each leaf. Total m=2.Fire left leaf: send 1 chip to center. Left leaf=0, center=1.Fire right leaf: send 1 chip to center. Right leaf=0, center=2.Now center has 2 chips, degree 2. Fire center: send 1 to left, 1 to right. Center=0, left=1, right=1.Repeat. So yes, with m=2=e=2, we can cycle indefinitely.So even in a tree, m=e works. Therefore, the presence of cycles is not necessary for m=e to be the answer. Thus, m=e is minimal for any connected graph.To confirm that m cannot be less than e, suppose m &lt; e. Then, consider that each edge needs to have at least one chip traverse it in each direction infinitely often. However, with fewer chips than edges, by the pigeonhole principle, there&#39;s at least one edge that doesn&#39;t have a chip associated with it, so it can&#39;t be part of the infinite operations. But this is hand-wavy.Alternatively, use induction on the number of edges. For a connected graph with e edges, the minimal m is e. Base case: e=1, tree with two vertices, m=1=e. Assume it&#39;s true for all graphs with fewer than e edges. Then for a graph with e edges, remove an edge (making it possibly disconnected), but this approach might not work.Alternatively, consider the problem as a conservation of chips. Since each operation preserves the total number of chips, and to have an infinite number of operations, the configuration must not reach a state where all vertices have fewer chips than their degrees. If we start with m chips, to avoid getting stuck, there must always be at least one vertex with chips &gt;= its degree.However, in a connected graph, if m &gt;= e, then it&#39;s possible to distribute the chips such that each edge has at least one chip &quot;in play&quot;. But how?Wait, another angle: the problem requires that there exists an initial configuration with m chips such that infinite operations are possible. We need the minimal such m.In chip-firing literature, a configuration is called &quot;recurrent&quot; if it can be fired infinitely often. For recurrent configurations in chip-firing, the number of chips must be equal to the number of edges minus the number of vertices plus 1 (the cyclomatic number). But in our examples, m=e, which is different. Wait, for a cycle graph with n=3, e=3. Cyclomatic number is e - n + 1 = 1. But m=3. So that formula doesn&#39;t match.Alternatively, maybe the answer is related to the total degree. But total degree is 2e. If m=2e, but in our examples m=e suffices.Alternatively, think of Eulerian circuits. If the graph is Eulerian, then maybe we can distribute chips such that following the Eulerian circuit allows infinite firing. But I don&#39;t see the direct connection.Wait, suppose the graph is Eulerian. Then there&#39;s a cycle that traverses every edge exactly once. If we place 2 chips on each vertex (since in an Eulerian circuit, each vertex has even degree), but this seems unrelated.Alternatively, think of each edge needing to have a chip pass through it in both directions. For an undirected graph, each edge is two-way. To have a chip move back and forth, you need at least one chip associated with the edge. But since each edge connects two vertices, you need at least one chip on one of the vertices to traverse the edge.If you have one chip per edge, then for each edge, you can have a chip on one of its endpoints, allowing it to traverse the edge when fired. But this would require m=e, one per edge. Then, by firing the appropriate vertices, you can move each chip along its edge, and since the graph is connected, you can sequence the firings to circulate the chips around cycles or back and forth along trees.Thus, m=e is the minimal number where you can assign one chip per edge, allowing each edge to have a chip that can traverse it, facilitating infinite operations. If you have fewer than e chips, then by pigeonhole principle, some edge won&#39;t have a chip nearby, making it impossible to sustain infinite operations.Therefore, after considering various examples and reasoning through conservation of chips and the necessity of having at least one chip per edge to maintain operations, I conclude that the minimal m is equal to the number of edges e.</p><div class="divider" data-v-f87f2ed0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f87f2ed0><span class="icon" data-v-f87f2ed0>✅:</span>The minimum value of ( m ) such that there exists an initial placement of ( m ) pieces allowing infinitely many operations on a connected simple graph ( G ) with ( e ) edges is ( boxed{e} ).Key Steps and Reasoning:1. Operation Conservation: Each operation (distributing ( d ) pieces from a vertex of degree ( d )) conserves the total number of pieces. Thus, ( m ) remains constant during all operations.2. Cycle Examples: For cyclic graphs (e.g., triangle, cycle), placing ( m = e ) pieces enables infinite operations by cycling distributions through vertices. For trees (e.g., path graphs, star graphs), ( m = e ) similarly allows perpetual back-and-forth or cyclical distribution along edges.3. Generalization: For any connected graph:   - Sufficiency: ( m = e ) guarantees at least one piece per edge. This ensures each edge can facilitate chip movement, sustaining infinite operations via sequential firings.   - Necessity: If ( m &lt; e ), the pigeonhole principle implies insufficient pieces to cover all edges, leading to eventual operational termination as some edges lack adjacent pieces.4. Chip-Firing Insight: While related to chip-firing games, the critical factor here is maintaining enough pieces to perpetually trigger vertex firings. ( m = e ) directly correlates with the graph&#39;s capacity to sustain such activity across all edges.Thus, the minimal ( m ) equals the number of edges ( e ), ensuring indefinite operations through structured piece redistribution.</p><div class="divider" data-v-f87f2ed0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f87f2ed0><span class="icon" data-v-f87f2ed0>🔑:</span>To find the minimum value of ( m ) such that there exists an initial placement of ( m ) pieces on the vertices of a connected simple graph ( G ) with ( e ) edges, such that you can perform the described operation infinitely many times, we need to go through several steps of careful reasoning. We will denote the number of vertices in ( G ) by ( n ).1. Vertex and Degree Definitions:   Let the set of vertices be ( V = { v_1, v_2, ldots, v_n } ), and let ( d_i ) be the degree (number of adjacent vertices) of vertex ( v_i ).2. Operational Description:   The operation involves selecting a vertex ( v_i ) with at least ( d_i ) pieces and redistributing ( d_i ) pieces to its adjacent vertices.3. Proof by Contradiction:   Suppose we have a placement of ( m ) pieces that allows infinite operations.   - Let ( S = (v_{t_1}, v_{t_2}, v_{t_3}, ldots) ) denote an infinite sequence of operations where each ( v_{t_i} ) represents an operation at vertex ( v_{t_i} ).4. Infinite Appearance of Each Vertex in Sequence:   We first prove that for each vertex ( v_i in V ), ( v_i ) appears infinitely many times in ( S ).   - Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a set ( A = { v_i mid v_i ) appears finitely many times in ( S } neq emptyset ).   - Then there exists a vertex ( v_j in A ) and ( v_k in V setminus A ) such that ( v_j ) and ( v_k ) are adjacent.5. Consider Sequence S:   If ( v_j in A ), there is a natural number ( N ) such that for all ( i &gt; N ) in ( S ), ( v_{t_i} notin A ).6. Redistribution Implications:   After ( N ) operations, the number of pieces on vertices in ( A ) does not decrease, while multiple operations on ( v_k ) will increase the pieces on ( v_j ), leading to a contradiction.7. Therefore:   Every vertex ( v_i ) must appear infinitely many times in ( S ).8. Relations and Constraints:   We will represent when each piece moves between vertices as related to an edge. Initially, no pieces are attached to any edge, but they may move along edges during operations.9. Construct a Valid Placement:   Suppose we initially place pieces such that the move ( v_i ) involves ( v_j ), ( v_{j_1}, v_{j_2}, ldots, v_{j_{d_i}} ).   - Pieces ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k ) on ( v_i ) are related to edges ( (v_i, v_{j_1}), (v_i, v_{j_2}), ldots, (v_i, v_{j_k}) ).   - Distribute remaining pieces ( a_{k+1}, ldots, a_{d_i} ) to ( v_{j_{k+1}}, ldots, v_{j_{d_i}} ).   - Each piece attaches to one edge, ensuring the containment between vertices and corresponding edges.10. Minimum Piece Count:    - Since each move along an edge implies a piece on that edge, and each edge must have at least one piece at some point, the graph requires at least ( e ) pieces initially.11. Final Placement Verification:    - A valid configuration is to place a piece on each edge by putting the piece on one of its endpoints. This can resemble a directed model, if vertices ( v_{1}, v_{2}, ldots, v_{n} ) satisfy prerequisites.12. Conclusion:    Therefore, the minimal number ( m ) of pieces needed such that you can perform the described operation infinitely many times starting from any valid initial placement is exactly:[boxed{e}]</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-68c9c52f data-v-f87f2ed0><div class="review" data-v-f87f2ed0><div class="review-title" data-v-f87f2ed0><span class="icon" data-v-f87f2ed0>❓:</span>Let (a &gt; b), where (x, y, z) are digits.

So, the task is to find two two-digit numbers, a and b, where a is three times b, and the sum of the digits of a is either 3 more or 3 less than the sum of the digits of b. Also, a has to be greater than b, and x, y, z are digits (meaning they can be from 0 to 9). The solution provided breaks it down into four cases based on how the digits of a and b relate to each other. Each case seems to define different positions for the digits in a and b. Let me go through each case step by step to make sure I follow the logic.Starting with Case 1a: Here, a is written as x*10 + y, so that&#39;s the tens digit x and the units digit y, making the number 10x + y. Then b is y*10 + z, which means b has the same units digit as a&#39;s tens digit? Wait, no. Wait, b is written as y*10 + z. So if a is 10x + y, then b is 10y + z. So, for example, if a is 72, then x=7, y=2, and b would be 24 (y=2, z=4). That makes sense. So in this case, the tens digit of b is the units digit of a, and the units digit of b is a new digit z.The system of equations given here is:10x + y = 3*(10y + z)  [since a is three times b]andx + y = (y + z) + 3  [sum of digits of a is 3 more than sum of digits of b]So simplifying these equations:First equation: 10x + y = 30y + 3z → 10x - 29y - 3z = 0Second equation: x + y = y + z + 3 → x = z + 3 → z = x - 3So substituting z from the second equation into the first equation:10x - 29y - 3(x - 3) = 0 → 10x -29y -3x +9 =0 →7x -29y = -9Now, the solution says this leads to x=7, y=2, z=4. Let me check if that works.Plugging x=7 into z = x -3: z=4. Then check the first equation: 7x -29y = -9 →7*7 -29*2 = 49 -58 = -9. Correct. So that works. Then a=72, b=24. Indeed, 72 is 3*24, and sum of digits for a is 7+2=9, for b is 2+4=6, and 9-6=3, which matches the condition. Great.Case 1b: Same a and b structure as 1a, but now the sum of digits of a is 3 less than that of b? Wait, the equations are:10x + y = 3*(10y + z)andx + y = (y + z) -3So sum of digits of a is 3 less than sum of digits of b. Let&#39;s see.First equation same as before: 10x -29y -3z=0Second equation: x + y = y + z -3 → x = z -3 → z = x +3Substituting into first equation: 10x -29y -3(x +3)=0 →10x -29y -3x -9=0 →7x -29y =9Now, we need x and y as digits (0-9), so let&#39;s see possible x and y.Since x is a digit, x can be from 0 to 9, but since a is a two-digit number, x is at least 1. Similarly, y is from 0 to 9, and z is x +3, so z must be ≤9. Therefore, x +3 ≤9 →x ≤6.So x can be 1 to 6.Let&#39;s plug x=1: 7*1 -29y =9 →7 -29y=9→ -29y=2→ y negative. Not possible.x=2:14 -29y=9→ -29y= -5→ y=5/29≈0.17. Not integer.x=3:21 -29y=9→ -29y= -12→ y=12/29≈0.41. Not integer.x=4:28 -29y=9→-29y= -19→ y=19/29≈0.65. Not integer.x=5:35 -29y=9→-29y= -26→ y≈0.896. Not integer.x=6:42 -29y=9→-29y= -33→ y=33/29≈1.137. Not integer.So none of the x from 1 to6 gives integer y. Therefore, no solution here, which matches the conclusion in the problem statement.Moving on to Case 2: Here, a is still x*10 + y, but b is z*10 +x. So b has the tens digit z and the units digit x. So in this case, the units digit of a is y, and the units digit of b is x, which is the tens digit of a. Interesting.The system of equations given is:10x + y = 3*(10z + x) →10x + y =30z +3x →7x + y =30zandx + y = (x + z) ±3 →x + y =x + z ±3 → y = z ±3So the second equation simplifies to y = z +3 or y = z -3.Therefore, substituting y = z ±3 into the first equation:7x + (z ±3)=30z →7x =30z - z ∓3 →7x=29z ∓3So, 7x =29z -3 or 7x=29z +3Since x and z are digits (0-9), let&#39;s check possible values.Starting with y = z +3:Then 7x =29z -3. Let&#39;s see possible z.z is from 0 to 9. Let&#39;s compute 29z -3 for z=0 to9:z=0: -3 →7x=-3→invalidz=1:29-3=26→7x=26→x≈3.71→not integerz=2:58-3=55→7x=55→x≈7.857→nopez=3:87-3=84→7x=84→x=12→x must be ≤9, invalidz=4:116-3=113→7x=113→x≈16.14→invalidSimilarly, higher z gives higher x beyond digit.Now for y = z -3:Then 7x=29z +3. Let&#39;s check z from 3 to9 (since y must be ≥0, z≥3):z=3:29*3 +3=90→7x=90→x≈12.85→invalidz=4:116 +3=119→x≈17→invalidz=5:145 +3=148→x≈21.14→invalidAnd so on. All z values lead to x exceeding 9. Therefore, no solutions here. Hence, empty set as per the problem.Case3: a =x*10 + y, b=x*10 + z. So both a and b share the same tens digit x, and their units digits are y and z. The problem states no digits satisfy the conditions. Let me verify.Equations:10x + y =3*(10x + z) →10x + y =30x +3z → -20x + y =3zSum of digits: x + y = x + z ±3 → y = z ±3So substituting y = z ±3 into first equation:-20x + (z ±3) =3z →-20x =3z - z ∓3 →-20x=2z ∓3 →20x= -2z ±3But x and z are digits (0-9), so left side 20x is non-negative (since x≥0) and right side is -2z ±3. But -2z ±3 would be negative or small positive. Let&#39;s see:20x= -2z +3 or 20x= -2z -3But 20x must be non-negative. For 20x= -2z +3, the RHS is ≤3 (since z≥0), but 20x is 0,20,40,... So only possible if x=0, then 0= -2z +3 →2z=3→z=1.5, not a digit. If x=0, 20x=0, so -2z +3=0→z=1.5 invalid. If x=1, 20= -2z +3→2z= -17→invalid.For 20x= -2z -3, RHS is negative, but LHS is non-negative. Impossible. Hence, no solutions. So Case3 indeed has no solutions.Case4: a =x*10 + y, b= z*10 + y. So a and b share the same units digit y. The tens digits are x and z for a and b respectively.Equations:10x + y =3*(10z + y) →10x + y =30z +3y →10x -2y =30zSum of digits: x + y = z + y ±3 →x = z ±3So substituting x = z ±3 into first equation:10(z ±3) -2y =30z →10z ±30 -2y =30z →-20z ±30 -2y =0 →-20z -2y = ∓30 →20z +2y = ±30 →10z +y = ±15But since z and y are digits (0-9), 10z + y is a two-digit number, which must equal 15 or -15. But since digits are non-negative, 10z + y =15.So 10z + y =15. Possible pairs (z,y):z=1, y=5 (10+5=15)z=0, y=15→invalid (y must be ≤9)z=2, y= -5→invalidSo only possible z=1, y=5.Given x = z ±3, so x =1 +3=4 or x=1 -3=-2 (invalid). Thus, x=4.Therefore, a=45 (x=4, y=5), b=15 (z=1, y=5). Check: 45 is 3*15, yes. Sum of digits:4+5=9 vs1+5=6. 9-6=3. Correct. So that works.Alternatively, if 10z +y= -15, but that&#39;s impossible as digits are non-negative. Hence, only solution is a=45, b=15.So the problem considered four different cases of how the digits of a and b could be related, solved the equations in each case, and found solutions only in Case1a and Case4. The other cases had no valid solutions.Let me verify if there are any other possible cases they might have missed. The four cases seem to cover different digit arrangements:Case1: b&#39;s tens digit is a&#39;s units digit.Case2: b&#39;s units digit is a&#39;s tens digit.Case3: a and b share the same tens digit.Case4: a and b share the same units digit.Are there other possible digit arrangements? Let&#39;s think. For example, could b&#39;s tens digit be a&#39;s tens digit? But that would be covered in Case3 or another case. Alternatively, b&#39;s digits could be entirely different, not overlapping with a&#39;s digits. But in that case, there&#39;s no relation between the digits, but the problem seems to be considering overlapping digits as per the cases. However, the problem statement mentions &quot;the decimal representation of the desired numbers&quot; but doesn&#39;t specify that the digits must overlap. However, the presented solution only considers cases where digits overlap. Maybe because if digits don&#39;t overlap, it&#39;s more variables and maybe no solutions? Let&#39;s check.Suppose Case5: a= x*10 + y, b= z*10 + w, with all digits x,y,z,w distinct. Then we have:10x + y =3*(10z + w)x + y = z + w ±3But this would introduce two new variables, making it more complex. Let&#39;s see if such solutions exist.But given that the original problem&#39;s solution didn&#39;t consider this case, maybe because there are no solutions or maybe it&#39;s beyond the scope. Let me check if such numbers exist.For example, let&#39;s see: Find two-digit a=3b, with sum of digits of a = sum of digits of b ±3, and digits of a and b don&#39;t overlap.Take a=72, b=24: digits overlap (2 in a and b). So the known solution is excluded here.Take a=45, b=15: digits 5 is common. So also overlapping.If we look for a=3b, sum digits differ by 3, no overlapping digits.Let me check possible a and b:Possible b from 10 to 33 (since a=3b must be two-digit, so b≤33). Let&#39;s list b and 3b:b=10, a=30. Sum digits:3+0=3 vs1+0=1. Difference 2. Not 3.b=11, a=33. Sum 3+3=6 vs1+1=2. Difference 4.b=12, a=36. Sum 3+6=9 vs1+2=3. Difference 6.b=13, a=39. Sum3+9=12 vs1+3=4. Difference 8.b=14, a=42. Sum4+2=6 vs1+4=5. Difference1.b=15, a=45. Sum4+5=9 vs1+5=6. Difference3. But digits 5 is common. Overlap.b=16, a=48. Sum4+8=12 vs1+6=7. Difference5.b=17, a=51. Sum5+1=6 vs1+7=8. Difference-2.b=18, a=54. Sum5+4=9 vs1+8=9. Difference0.b=19, a=57. Sum5+7=12 vs1+9=10. Difference2.b=20, a=60. Sum6+0=6 vs2+0=2. Difference4.b=21, a=63. Sum6+3=9 vs2+1=3. Difference6.b=22, a=66. Sum6+6=12 vs2+2=4. Difference8.b=23, a=69. Sum6+9=15 vs2+3=5. Difference10.b=24, a=72. Sum7+2=9 vs2+4=6. Difference3. But digits 2 is common. Overlap.b=25, a=75. Sum7+5=12 vs2+5=7. Difference5.b=26, a=78. Sum7+8=15 vs2+6=8. Difference7.b=27, a=81. Sum8+1=9 vs2+7=9. Difference0.b=28, a=84. Sum8+4=12 vs2+8=10. Difference2.b=29, a=87. Sum8+7=15 vs2+9=11. Difference4.b=30, a=90. Sum9+0=9 vs3+0=3. Difference6.b=31, a=93. Sum9+3=12 vs3+1=4. Difference8.b=32, a=96. Sum9+6=15 vs3+2=5. Difference10.b=33, a=99. Sum9+9=18 vs3+3=6. Difference12.So looking through all these, the only cases where the sum difference is 3 are b=15 (overlap), b=24 (overlap). Therefore, there are no solutions where the digits don&#39;t overlap. Hence, the original cases considered (where digits do overlap) are sufficient to cover all possible solutions. So the initial approach of considering overlapping digits is valid because non-overlapping cases don&#39;t yield solutions.Therefore, the only solutions are a=72, b=24 and a=45, b=15. The problem&#39;s solution process seems comprehensive, considering all possible digit arrangements where overlap occurs, leading to these two solutions. The other cases either don&#39;t yield solutions or result in non-digit values.I should also verify if there are any other possibilities within the cases mentioned. For example, in Case4, the equations led to a=45, b=15. Let&#39;s confirm:a=45 is 3*15=45. Correct. Sum of digits:4+5=9 vs1+5=6. Difference 9-6=3. Correct.Is there another solution in Case4? Let&#39;s see.From Case4&#39;s equations:10x + y =3*(10z + y) →10x + y=30z +3y →10x -2y=30zAnd x= z ±3.So substituting x= z +3:10(z +3) -2y=30z →10z +30 -2y=30z →-20z +30=2y →y= (-20z +30)/2= -10z +15Since y must be a digit between 0-9:-10z +15 ≥0 →-10z ≥-15 →z ≤1.5. Since z is a digit, z=0 or1.z=0: y= -0 +15=15→invalid (y must be ≤9)z=1:y= -10*1 +15=5. Valid. So x=1+3=4, y=5. Thus, a=45, b=15. That&#39;s the only solution here.If we consider x=z -3:10(z -3) -2y=30z →10z -30 -2y=30z →-20z -30=2y →y= -10z -15But y must be ≥0, so -10z -15 ≥0→-10z ≥15→z ≤-1.5. Impossible since z is a digit ≥0. Hence, no solutions here.Therefore, only one solution in Case4.Similarly, in Case1a, x=7, y=2, z=4 is the only solution. Let&#39;s check if there could be other solutions:Equation:7x -29y =-9. We need x,y digits (x 1-9, y 0-9).Looking for integer solutions where x,y are digits.Rearranged:7x=29y -9So 29y -9 must be divisible by7.29y ≡9 mod7. Since29≡1 mod7, so 29y≡y mod7. Thus, y ≡9 mod7→ y≡2 mod7.Possible y=2,9. But y is a digit (0-9).Testing y=2:7x=29*2 -9=58-9=49→x=7. Valid.Testing y=9:7x=29*9 -9=261-9=252→x=36. Not a digit. Hence, only y=2 gives valid x=7.Thus, only one solution here.Therefore, the problem&#39;s solutions are exhaustive, and the cases considered cover all possible scenarios. Thus, the final solutions are a=72, b=24 and a=45, b=15.</p><div class="divider" data-v-f87f2ed0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f87f2ed0><span class="icon" data-v-f87f2ed0>✅:</span>The problem requires finding two-digit numbers (a) and (b) such that (a = 3b) and the sum of (a)&#39;s digits differs by 3 from the sum of (b)&#39;s digits.

Hmm, let me start by computing the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.Starting with a₁ = 0 and a₂ = 1. Let&#39;s compute a₃. For n=3, we take the max over i=1 and i=2.For i=1: a₁ + a₂ + 1 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.For i=2: a₂ + a₁ + 2 = 1 + 0 + 2 = 3.So the maximum is 3, so a₃ = 3.Now a₄. For n=4, i can be 1, 2, or 3.i=1: a₁ + a₃ +1 = 0 + 3 +1 =4.i=2: a₂ + a₂ +2 =1 +1 +2=4.i=3: a₃ + a₁ +3=3 +0 +3=6.Maximum is 6, so a₄=6.a₅: n=5, i from 1 to 4.i=1: a₁ + a₄ +1=0 +6 +1=7.i=2: a₂ + a₃ +2=1 +3 +2=6.i=3: a₃ + a₂ +3=3 +1 +3=7.i=4: a₄ + a₁ +4=6 +0 +4=10.Maximum is 10, so a₅=10.a₆: n=6, i=1 to 5.i=1: a₁ + a₅ +1=0 +10 +1=11.i=2: a₂ + a₄ +2=1 +6 +2=9.i=3: a₃ + a₃ +3=3 +3 +3=9.i=4: a₄ + a₂ +4=6 +1 +4=11.i=5: a₅ + a₁ +5=10 +0 +5=15.Maximum is 15, so a₆=15.Wait a second, let me check these computations again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.a₁=0, a₂=1, a₃=3, a₄=6, a₅=10, a₆=15. Hmm, these numbers look familiar. 0,1,3,6,10,15... These are triangular numbers! The sequence where each term is the sum of the first (k) integers starting from 0. Wait, the nth triangular number is n(n−1)/2. Let me check:For n=1: 1(0)/2=0. Correct.n=2: 2(1)/2=1. Correct.n=3: 3(2)/2=3. Correct.n=4: 4(3)/2=6. Correct.n=5: 5(4)/2=10. Correct.n=6:6(5)/2=15. Yes, that&#39;s exactly the pattern. So maybe the general term is aₙ = n(n−1)/2. But wait, let&#39;s check if this formula holds for n=3,4,5,6 as computed, and whether it satisfies the recurrence relation.But before assuming that, let me check a₇ to see if the pattern continues.Compute a₇: For n=7, i=1 to 6.i=1: a₁ + a₆ +1=0 +15 +1=16.i=2: a₂ + a₅ +2=1 +10 +2=13.i=3: a₃ + a₄ +3=3 +6 +3=12.i=4: a₄ + a₃ +4=6 +3 +4=13.i=5: a₅ + a₂ +5=10 +1 +5=16.i=6: a₆ + a₁ +6=15 +0 +6=21.Maximum is 21. Then a₇=21. Which is 7*6/2=21. Yes, so a₇=21. So the pattern continues. So up to n=7, the formula aₙ = n(n−1)/2 holds. Let&#39;s check n=8.a₈: i=1 to 7.i=1: a₁ + a₇ +1=0 +21 +1=22.i=2: a₂ + a₆ +2=1 +15 +2=18.i=3: a₃ + a₅ +3=3 +10 +3=16.i=4: a₄ + a₄ +4=6 +6 +4=16.i=5: a₅ + a₃ +5=10 +3 +5=18.i=6: a₆ + a₂ +6=15 +1 +6=22.i=7: a₇ + a₁ +7=21 +0 +7=28.Maximum is 28. Which is 8*7/2=28. So a₈=28. So yes, the pattern continues. So it seems the formula is aₙ = n(n−1)/2. But we need to verify if this formula satisfies the recurrence relation for all n. Let&#39;s try to prove it by induction.Base case: For n=1, a₁=0=1*0/2. Correct. n=2, a₂=1=2*1/2. Correct.Assume that for all k ≤ m, a_k = k(k−1)/2. Now consider a_{m+1}. According to the recurrence:a_{m+1} = max_{1 ≤ i ≤ m} [a_i + a_{m+1−i} + i]By the induction hypothesis, a_i = i(i−1)/2 and a_{m+1−i} = (m+1−i)(m−i)/2.So substitute into the expression:a_i + a_{m+1−i} + i = [i(i−1)/2] + [(m+1−i)(m−i)/2] + i.Let me compute this:First term: [i(i−1) + (m+1−i)(m−i)] / 2 + iLet me expand the numerator:i(i−1) + (m+1−i)(m−i) = i² - i + (m+1−i)(m−i)Expand (m+1−i)(m−i) = (m−i)(m+1−i) = m(m−i) +1*(m−i) -i(m−i) -i*1Wait, perhaps better to just multiply it out:(m+1−i)(m−i) = m(m−i) +1*(m−i) -i(m−i) -i*1Wait, actually, let me do it properly:(m+1−i)(m−i) = (m+1)(m−i) - i(m−i) = m(m−i) +1*(m−i) -i(m−i)= m² - mi + m - i - mi + i²= m² - 2mi + m - i + i²Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to compute (m+1−i)(m−i):Let me denote j = m - i, then it&#39;s (j +1)(j) = j² + j.But maybe that&#39;s not helpful. Alternatively, let&#39;s compute:(m+1−i)(m−i) = (m−i +1)(m−i) = (m−i)(m−i) + (m−i)*1 = (m−i)² + (m−i)Similarly, i(i−1) = i² - i.So the numerator becomes:i² - i + (m−i)² + (m−i) = i² - i + (m² - 2mi + i²) + m - iCombine terms:i² - i + m² -2mi + i² + m - i = 2i² - 2i + m² -2mi + mSo the entire expression is [2i² - 2i + m² -2mi + m]/2 + iSimplify:Divide each term by 2:(2i²)/2 - (2i)/2 + m²/2 -2mi/2 + m/2 + iWhich simplifies to:i² - i + (m²)/2 - mi + m/2 + iSimplify terms:The -i and +i cancel. So:i² + (m²)/2 - mi + m/2So overall, the expression becomes:i² - mi + (m²)/2 + m/2Factor terms with i:i² - mi + (m² + m)/2This is a quadratic in terms of i: i² - mi + (m² + m)/2We need to find the maximum of this quadratic expression for integer i between 1 and m.But since i is an integer, we can find the maximum over i=1,2,...,m.However, quadratic functions can have their maximum at the endpoints if the quadratic opens upwards or downwards.The quadratic is i² - mi + (m² + m)/2. The coefficient of i² is 1, which is positive, so it opens upwards. Hence, it will have a minimum at the vertex, and maximum at the endpoints.Therefore, the maximum occurs either at i=1 or at i=m.Wait, but when dealing with integers, even if the vertex is not an integer, the maximum of a convex function on an interval is at the endpoints.So, in this case, since the quadratic is convex (opens upwards), its maximum over the interval [1, m] will be at either i=1 or i=m.Therefore, we can compute the value at i=1 and i=m and take the maximum.Compute at i=1:Expression = 1² - m*1 + (m² + m)/2 = 1 - m + (m² + m)/2.Simplify:1 - m + (m²)/2 + m/2 = (m²)/2 - m/2 + 1.At i=m:Expression = m² - m*m + (m² + m)/2 = m² - m² + (m² + m)/2 = 0 + (m² + m)/2 = (m² + m)/2.Compare (m² + m)/2 vs (m²)/2 - m/2 + 1.Which is larger?Compute (m² + m)/2 - [(m²)/2 - m/2 +1] = (m² + m)/2 - (m² - m + 2)/2 = [m² + m - m² + m - 2]/2 = [2m - 2]/2 = m - 1.So if m -1 &gt;0, which is true for m ≥2, then (m² + m)/2 is larger than the other expression.Thus, the maximum occurs at i=m.But wait, i ranges up to m, but when we compute a_{m+1}, the index i goes up to m. However, in the original problem statement, when we compute aₙ, i ranges from 1 to n−1. Wait, hold on, here we&#39;re looking at a_{m+1}, so n = m+1, and i ranges from 1 to m. So i=m is allowed.Therefore, the maximum value is at i=m, which gives (m² + m)/2.But according to the formula we are trying to establish, a_{m+1} should be (m+1)m/2 = (m² +m)/2. Which matches the value we obtained at i=m.Therefore, the maximum of the expression is indeed (m² +m)/2, which is equal to a_{m+1} = (m+1)m/2. Hence, the induction step holds.Therefore, by mathematical induction, the general term of the sequence is aₙ = n(n−1)/2 for all n ≥1.But let me double-check this with another approach to ensure there&#39;s no mistake. Suppose we consider splitting the sequence at some i, then aₙ = a_i + a_{n−i} + i. If aₙ = n(n−1)/2, then substituting into the right-hand side:a_i + a_{n−i} + i = [i(i−1)/2] + [(n−i)(n−i−1)/2] + i.Let&#39;s compute this:= [i² - i + (n−i)(n−i−1)] / 2 + iExpand (n−i)(n−i−1):= (n−i)(n−i) - (n−i)= (n−i)^2 - (n−i)So:[i² - i + (n−i)^2 - (n−i)] /2 + i= [i² - i + n² - 2ni + i² - n + i] /2 + iCombine like terms:i² + i² = 2i²-i + i = 0-2nin² -nSo numerator: 2i² - 2ni + n² -nDivide by 2:(2i² - 2ni + n² -n)/2 + i= i² - ni + (n² -n)/2 + i= i² - ni + i + (n² -n)/2= i² - (n -1)i + (n² -n)/2Now, compare this to aₙ = n(n−1)/2 = (n² -n)/2.So we need to check if for the maximum over i, the expression i² - (n -1)i + (n² -n)/2 equals (n² -n)/2.Which would require that i² - (n -1)i =0. So i(i - (n -1))=0. Therefore, i=0 or i=n−1. But i ranges from 1 to n−1, so the maximum would be achieved when i=n−1.Wait, if we set i = n−1, then:i² - (n -1)i + (n² -n)/2 = (n−1)^2 - (n -1)(n−1) + (n² -n)/2 = 0 + (n² -n)/2 = aₙ.Which is correct.Alternatively, for i=1:1 - (n−1) + (n² -n)/2 = (1 -n +1) + (n² -n)/2 = (2 -n) + (n² -n)/2.Compare to aₙ=(n² -n)/2. So the difference is (2 -n), which is negative for n≥3. Hence, the maximum is indeed achieved at i=n−1, leading to aₙ=(n² -n)/2.Therefore, the formula holds for all n.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a more combinatorial interpretation. The term aₙ represents the maximum sum obtained by splitting the sequence at some point i, adding a_i and a_{n−i} and then adding i. If the maximum is always achieved at i=n−1 (or equivalently i=1, due to symmetry?), then this would lead to a recursive relation similar to the triangular numbers.But given that the induction proof works and the computations for specific n up to 8 hold, it&#39;s safe to conclude that the general term is aₙ = n(n−1)/2.Therefore, the answer should be aₙ = n(n−1)/2, which is the nth triangular number starting from n=1.Final AnswerThe general term of the sequence is boxed{dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}}.</p><div class="divider" data-v-f87f2ed0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f87f2ed0><span class="icon" data-v-f87f2ed0>✅:</span>To determine the general term of the sequence left{a_{n}right} defined by a_{1}=0, a_{2}=1, and for n geq 3, a_{n} = max_{1 leq i leq n-1}left{a_{i} + a_{n-i} + iright}, we start by computing the first few terms:- a_{1} = 0- a_{2} = 1- a_{3} = max{0 + 1 + 1, 1 + 0 + 2} = max{2, 3} = 3- a_{4} = max{0 + 3 + 1, 1 + 1 + 2, 3 + 0 + 3} = max{4, 4, 6} = 6- a_{5} = max{0 + 6 + 1, 1 + 3 + 2, 3 + 1 + 3, 6 + 0 + 4} = max{7, 6, 7, 10} = 10- a_{6} = max{0 + 10 + 1, 1 + 6 + 2, 3 + 3 + 3, 6 + 1 + 4, 10 + 0 + 5} = max{11, 9, 9, 11, 15} = 15- a_{7} = max{0 + 15 + 1, 1 + 10 + 2, 3 + 6 + 3, 6 + 3 + 4, 10 + 1 + 5, 15 + 0 + 6} = max{16, 13, 12, 13, 16, 21} = 21- a_{8} = max{0 + 21 + 1, 1 + 15 + 2, 3 + 10 + 3, 6 + 6 + 4, 10 + 3 + 5, 15 + 1 + 6, 21 + 0 + 7} = max{22, 18, 16, 16, 18, 22, 28} = 28These terms correspond to the triangular numbers, which are given by the formula a_n = frac{n(n-1)}{2}.

The sigma-algebra generated by mathscr{A} can be quite complex. However, in certain cases, it is possible to explicitly identify a system S(mathscr{A}) that is slightly larger than sigma(mathscr{A}) but has the same cardinality as sigma(mathscr{A}).Define the A-operation (also known as the Alexandrov operation or Suslin operation) for any A-family, i.e., a family of setsleft{A_{n_{1} ldots n_{k}}right} = left{A_{n_{1} ldots n_{k}}, k geqslant 1, n_{1}, n_{2}, ldots = 1, 2, ldotsright},as the setbigcup_{n_{infty}} bigcap_{k=1}^{infty} A_{n_{1} ldots n_{k}},where the union is taken over all infinite sequences n_{infty} = left(n_{1}, n_{2}, ldotsright) of natural numbers.Let S(mathscr{A}) be the class of all sets obtained by applying the A-operation to all A-subsystems left{A_{n_{1} ldots n_{k}}right} subseteq mathscr{A}.

Also, if the complement of any element of 𝒜 is in S(𝒜), then S(𝒜) contains σ(𝒜). Hmm. Let&#39;s start by understanding all the terms here.First, the A-operation, or Suslin operation, is defined for an A-family, which is a family of sets indexed by finite sequences of natural numbers. The operation itself is taking the union over all infinite sequences n_∞ of the intersections of the sets A_{n1...nk} for each k. So, for each infinite sequence, you intersect the sets along the finite initial segments and then take the union of all those intersections. That gives the result of the A-operation on that family.Now, S(𝒜) is the class of all sets obtained by applying this A-operation to any A-subsystem (i.e., any family {A_{n1...nk}} that&#39;s a subset of 𝒜). So, every set in S(𝒜) is the result of some A-operation applied to some family of sets from 𝒜.The first task is to show that S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation. That means, if I take any A-family in S(𝒜) (instead of 𝒜), apply the A-operation to it, the result is still in S(𝒜). Wait, but S(𝒜) is built by applying A-operations to families from 𝒜. So if I have an A-family in S(𝒜), each set in that family is already in S(𝒜), which is obtained by some A-operation on 𝒜. So applying the A-operation again should still be in S(𝒜). But how exactly?I need to show that if I have a family {B_{n1...nk}} where each B_{n1...nk} is in S(𝒜), then the result of the A-operation on this family is also in S(𝒜). To do this, I need to express this result as an A-operation applied to some family in 𝒜. Since each B_{n1...nk} is in S(𝒜), each is an A-operation over some family in 𝒜. So maybe I can nest these operations?Wait, but the A-operation is a combination of countable unions and intersections. But the problem is that the A-operation is a specific kind of combination: a union over all infinite sequences of intersections along the initial segments. So perhaps I can find a way to encode the application of multiple A-operations into a single one. Let me think.Suppose that each B_{n1...nk} is itself an A-operation over some family in 𝒜. Let&#39;s denote B_{n1...nk} = A({C^{(n1...nk)}_{m1...ml}}), where each C^{(n1...nk)}_{m1...ml} is in 𝒜. Then applying the A-operation to the B&#39;s would involve another layer of unions and intersections. Maybe by interleaving the indices, I can combine these two A-operations into a single one. This is similar to how in topology, the closure under countable unions and intersections can sometimes be achieved by cleverly encoding multiple operations into one.For example, if I have a countable union of countable unions, it&#39;s still a countable union by reindexing. Similarly, here, perhaps we can interleave the sequences. Let me try to formalize this.Suppose we have an A-family {B_{s} }, where each B_{s} is in S(𝒜). So each B_{s} is of the form A({C^{s}_{t}}) where {C^{s}_{t}} is an A-family in 𝒜. Then the A-operation applied to {B_{s}} is:⋃_{s} ⋂_{k} B_{s|k} = ⋃_{s} ⋂_{k} [ ⋃_{t^s} ⋂_{m} C^{s|k}_{t^s|m} } ]Hmm, this is getting complicated. Each B_{s|k} is itself a union over t^s sequences of intersections of C&#39;s. So substituting that into the expression, we get a double union: ⋃_s ⋃_{t^s} ⋂_k ⋂_m C^{s|k}_{t^s|m}. Wait, but how exactly does this substitution work?Wait, maybe we need to consider that for each s (infinite sequence) and each k, B_{s|k} is ⋃_{t^k} ⋂_{m} C^{s|k}_{t^k|m}. So the entire expression becomes:⋃_{s} ⋂_{k} [ ⋃_{t^k} ⋂_{m} C^{s|k}_{t^k|m} } ]But then, moving the intersection inside the union would require some kind of distributive law, but intersections over unions don&#39;t distribute in general. So that might not work. However, in descriptive set theory, sometimes these operations can be combined by using a more complex indexing.Alternatively, maybe we can encode both sequences s and t into a single master sequence. Let&#39;s think about how sequences can be interleaved. Suppose we have an infinite sequence u of natural numbers. We can split u into two interleaved sequences s and t, where s is the even indices and t is the odd indices or something like that. But actually, for the A-operation, we need to have a single infinite sequence that can encode both the original sequence s and the sequences t^k used in each B_{s|k}.Wait, here&#39;s a standard trick: to encode a countable collection of sequences into a single sequence. For example, if we have for each k a sequence t^k, we can arrange them into a matrix and then read them off in a diagonal way. But in this case, we need to handle, for each initial segment s|k, a sequence t^k that is used to build B_{s|k}. So for each k, we have a sequence t^k of length depending on the level in the A-operation for B_{s|k}.This seems complicated, but maybe we can find a way to organize all these t^k sequences into a single master sequence. Let&#39;s try to formalize this.Let’s denote the original A-operation on the B’s as:A({B_{n1...nk}}) = ⋃_{s ∈ ℕ^ℕ} ⋂_{k=1}^∞ B_{s|k}But each B_{s|k} is itself A({C^{s|k}_{m1...ml}}), so:B_{s|k} = ⋃_{t ∈ ℕ^ℕ} ⋂_{l=1}^∞ C^{s|k}_{t|l}Therefore, substituting back, we get:A({B_{n1...nk}}) = ⋃_{s ∈ ℕ^ℕ} ⋂_{k=1}^∞ [ ⋃_{t ∈ ℕ^ℕ} ⋂_{l=1}^∞ C^{s|k}_{t|l} ]This expression is a union over s of the intersection over k of unions over t of intersections over l of C^{s|k}_{t|l}.Now, exchanging the order of intersections and unions is tricky here. The intersection over k of unions over t is a more complex operation. However, in some cases, this can be rewritten as a union over certain collections of sequences. Specifically, if we consider that for each k, we have a choice of t^k, then perhaps the entire expression can be rewritten as a union over all possible sequences of t^k&#39;s, indexed by k, and then the intersection over k and l of C^{s|k}_{t^k|l}.But how do we encode such a choice?Alternatively, think of the entire operation as a single A-operation over a suitably defined family. Let&#39;s try to construct such a family.Let’s define a new A-family {D_{u1...um}} where each D_{u1...um} is in 𝒜. The idea is that the A-operation over this D-family will reproduce the expression above.To do this, we need to map the complex combination of unions and intersections into a single A-operation. Let&#39;s note that the expression involves a union over s, and for each s, an intersection over k, which involves a union over t^k and an intersection over l. So, in total, it&#39;s like a union over s and all possible sequences t^1, t^2, ..., where each t^k is an infinite sequence. But ℕ^ℕ is a Baire space, and the product of countably many ℕ^ℕ is also homeomorphic to ℕ^ℕ. Therefore, we can encode the sequences s and the sequences t^1, t^2, ... into a single master sequence u ∈ ℕ^ℕ.For example, use a pairing function to interleave the bits of s and all the t^k&#39;s. However, this might get complicated. Alternatively, note that the entire construction can be represented as a tree. Each node at depth k corresponds to the initial segment s|k, and for each such node, we have a subtree corresponding to the A-operation for B_{s|k}, which is a union over t^k of intersections over l of C^{s|k}_{t^k|l}.But perhaps instead of thinking in terms of trees, we can index the D-family in a way that captures this structure.Suppose we want to represent the combination of s and all the t^k sequences. Each position in the master sequence u corresponds to a node in a tree where each node has a branch for s and branches for each t^k. Wait, maybe using a tree with two types of nodes: one for the s sequence and one for each t^k sequence. But this seems too vague.Alternatively, since each B_{s|k} is built from a family {C^{s|k}_{m1...ml}}, perhaps we can amalgamate all these families into a single family indexed by more complex finite sequences.For example, suppose that for each finite sequence (n1, n2, ..., nk), which is part of the original A-family {B_{n1...nk}}, and since each B_{n1...nk} is itself an A-operation over {C^{n1...nk}_{m1...ml}}, then maybe we can create a new family where each element is indexed by a concatenation of sequences. So, for the original sequence (n1, n2, ..., nk) that leads to B_{n1...nk}, and then for each B_{n1...nk}, we have another sequence (m1, m2, ..., ml) indexing the C sets.Therefore, the new family D would be indexed by pairs of sequences: ( (n1, ..., nk), (m1, ..., ml) ). But the A-operation requires a family indexed by single sequences. So we need a way to encode pairs of sequences into a single sequence. This is possible by using a pairing function, like interleaving. For example, a sequence u can be split into two interleaved sequences s and t, such that u(1), u(3), u(5), ... form s, and u(2), u(4), u(6), ... form t.But in our case, it&#39;s more complicated because for each k, we have a different sequence t^k. Wait, maybe we can think of the master sequence as consisting of the sequence s interleaved with all the t^k sequences. For example, the master sequence u could be structured such that for each k, the k-th block of u encodes t^k. However, since each t^k is an infinite sequence, we need to interleave their elements.Alternatively, use a master sequence u where each position is a pair (k, m), but since we need a linear order, we can use a bijection between ℕ × ℕ and ℕ. For example, using a diagonal enumeration: u is a function from ℕ to ℕ, and we can use u to encode for each k and m, the value t^k(m). Then, the sequence u would encode all the t^k sequences as its components.But how do we use this to index the D family? Let&#39;s try to formalize this.Define the master sequence u as follows: for each k, m ∈ ℕ, let t^k(m) = u(⟨k, m⟩), where ⟨k, m⟩ is a pairing function (like Cantor&#39;s pairing). Then, given the original sequences s and all t^k, we can construct u such that u encodes both s and all t^k. However, we need to encode s as well. So perhaps u is split into two parts: one part encoding s, and another part encoding all the t^k.But maybe this is overcomplicating. Let&#39;s try a different approach.Suppose we have the original A-operation over the B&#39;s, which are themselves A-operations over C&#39;s. Then, the entire expression is:⋃_s ⋂_k [ ⋃_{t^k} ⋂_l C^{s|k}_{t^k| l} ]This can be rephrased as:⋃_s ⋃_{t^1, t^2, ...} ⋂_k ⋂_l C^{s|k}_{t^k| l}But the union over all sequences t^1, t^2, ... is an uncountable union, which is not allowed in standard set operations. However, the A-operation only involves a countable union (over all infinite sequences), but here we have a union over countably many infinite sequences (t^1, t^2, ...), which would require a countable number of choices, each being an infinite sequence. Wait, but the set of all such sequences t^1, t^2, ... is isomorphic to (ℕ^ℕ)^ℕ, which has the same cardinality as ℕ^ℕ, since ℕ^ℕ is a Baire space and (ℕ^ℕ)^ℕ is homeomorphic to ℕ^(ℕ×ℕ), which is equivalent to ℕ^ℕ via a bijection between ℕ×ℕ and ℕ.Therefore, perhaps we can encode the sequences s and the sequences t^1, t^2, ... into a single master sequence u ∈ ℕ^ℕ. Then, the expression becomes:⋃_u [ ⋂_k ⋂_l C^{s|k}_{t^k| l} ]where s and each t^k are extracted from u.To do this, we need a way to extract s and all t^k from a single u. Let&#39;s define u such that:- For each k, the k-th component of s is u(2k - 1)- For each k, m, the m-th component of t^k is u(2^{k+1} * (2m - 1)) or some similar encoding.Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe use a more straightforward encoding. For example, use a pairing function to split u into s and a sequence that encodes all t^k. For instance, split u into two parts: the first part is s, and the second part is a master sequence from which we can extract each t^k. However, even this requires some finesse.Alternatively, think of u as a matrix where each row corresponds to a t^k sequence, and the first row is s. But since u is a single infinite sequence, we can map it to a matrix using a pairing function. For example, u can be arranged into a two-dimensional grid where u(i, j) = u(⟨i, j⟩), and then s is the first row, t^1 is the second row, t^2 is the third row, and so on. But in reality, u is a single sequence, so each position corresponds to a pair (i, j) via the pairing function.Therefore, define s(n) = u(⟨0, n⟩), t^k(n) = u(⟨k + 1, n⟩). Then, given u, we can reconstruct s and all t^k. Now, with this encoding, the original expression can be rewritten as:⋃_u [ ⋂_{k=1}^∞ ⋂_{l=1}^∞ C^{s|k}_{t^k| l} ]But wait, in the original expression, for each k, we have ⋂_{l=1}^∞ C^{s|k}_{t^k| l}. So, for each k, t^k is an infinite sequence, and we take the intersection over l of C^{s|k}_{t^k| l}. So, for each k, this is the A-operation applied to the family {C^{s|k}_{m1...ml}}.Therefore, the entire expression is equivalent to:⋃_u ⋂_{k=1}^∞ [ A-operation applied to {C^{s|k}_{m1...ml}} with t^k ]But since each A-operation is over 𝒜, combining all these into a single A-operation over a new family D would require defining D such that each D_{u1...um} corresponds to some C^{s|k}_{t^k| l} where s and t^k are determined by u.Alternatively, perhaps define a new A-family {D_{n1 n2 ... nk}} where each D_{n1 n2 ... nk} is equal to C^{s|k}_{t^k| l} for some s and t^k derived from the sequence n1 n2 ... nk.But I need to be precise here. Let&#39;s try to define the family D such that applying the A-operation to D gives the desired set.Suppose that for each finite sequence w = (n1, n2, ..., nk), we need to define D_w in terms of the C sets. The key idea is that the sequence w encodes both the sequence s and the sequences t^1, t^2, ..., t^k needed up to level k. Wait, but how?Alternatively, think of the finite sequence w as encoding the initial segments of s and each t^m for m ≤ k. For example, the first k elements of w could determine s|k and t^1|k, t^2|k, ..., t^k|k. But this seems too restrictive because t^m is an infinite sequence for each m.Alternatively, use a tree structure where each node is labeled by a pair (s|k, t^k|l). But this might not lead directly to an A-family.Wait, another approach. Since the A-operation is a Suslin operation, and the class S(𝒜) is closed under the Suslin operation, this might be a standard result in descriptive set theory. Perhaps I need to recall that the Suslin operation is idempotent, meaning that applying it twice doesn&#39;t give anything new, hence S(𝒜) is closed under A-operations.But the problem is that in the question, S(𝒜) is defined as the class of sets obtained by applying the A-operation to subsystems of 𝒜. So if we apply the A-operation again to families in S(𝒜), we need to show that the result can still be expressed as an A-operation over 𝒜.This is similar to showing that the Suslin operation is idempotent, which I think is a known result. The key idea is that combining two A-operations can be expressed as a single A-operation by appropriately reindexing the sequences.So, given that each set in S(𝒜) is an A-operation over 𝒜, then applying the A-operation to such sets would involve a combination of these operations, which can be merged into a single A-operation by using a more complex indexing. Therefore, the resulting set is also in S(𝒜).Therefore, to formalize this, suppose we have an A-family {B_{n1...nk}} in S(𝒜). Each B_{n1...nk} is equal to A({C^{n1...nk}_{m1...ml}}) for some A-family {C^{n1...nk}_{m1...ml}} ⊆ 𝒜.Then, the A-operation applied to {B_{n1...nk}} is:A({B_{n1...nk}}) = ⋃_{s ∈ ℕ^ℕ} ⋂_{k=1}^∞ B_{s|k} = ⋃_{s} ⋂_{k} A({C^{s|k}_{m1...ml}})= ⋃_{s} ⋂_{k} [ ⋃_{t^k ∈ ℕ^ℕ} ⋂_{l=1}^∞ C^{s|k}_{t^k|l} ]Now, as before, this expression is a union over s of intersections over k of unions over t^k of intersections over l of C^{s|k}_{t^k|l}.To rewrite this as a single A-operation, we need to find a way to encode the sequences s and all t^k into a single master sequence u, such that the intersections and unions can be reorganized accordingly.Let’s define a mapping from master sequences u to pairs (s, {t^k}) where s is an infinite sequence and each t^k is an infinite sequence. Using a bijection between ℕ and ℕ × ℕ, we can encode each t^k as a column in a grid, and s as another column. For example, use a bijection π: ℕ → ℕ × ℕ, and then define for each u, s(n) = u(π^{-1}(0, n)) and t^k(n) = u(π^{-1}(k, n)). This way, the master sequence u encodes s and all t^k.Using such an encoding, the expression becomes:⋃_{u ∈ ℕ^ℕ} ⋂_{k=1}^∞ ⋂_{l=1}^∞ C^{s|k}_{t^k|l}But note that in the original expression, for each k, we have ⋂_{l=1}^∞ C^{s|k}_{t^k|l}, which is the intersection along the l-index for each fixed k. However, in the master expression, we would need to have intersections over both k and l. But how does that translate?Wait, actually, if we fix u, then s and all t^k are fixed. Then, for each k and l, C^{s|k}_{t^k|l} is a set in 𝒜. Therefore, the entire expression is:⋃_{u} ⋂_{k,l} C^{s|k}_{t^k|l}But this is equivalent to:⋃_{u} ⋂_{n=1}^∞ C^{s|k_n}_{t^{k_n}|l_n}where (k_n, l_n) is an enumeration of ℕ × ℕ. However, the A-operation requires an intersection over a single index, not a grid. So, perhaps we can flatten the grid into a single index.Alternatively, note that the intersection over k and l can be rephrased as an intersection over a single index m, where m corresponds to a pair (k, l). Thus, if we let m enumerate all pairs (k, l), then:⋂_{k,l} C^{s|k}_{t^k|l} = ⋂_{m=1}^∞ C^{s|k(m)}_{t^{k(m)}| l(m)}where m ↦ (k(m), l(m)) is a bijection between ℕ and ℕ × ℕ.But then, the entire expression becomes:⋃_{u} ⋂_{m=1}^∞ C^{s|k(m)}_{t^{k(m)}| l(m)}But this is almost an A-operation, except that the indexing of the C sets is more complex. To make this into an A-operation, we need to define a family {D_{n1...nm}} such that D_{n1...nm} = C^{s|k(m)}_{t^{k(m)}| l(m)}.But here, s and t^{k(m)} are determined by u, which in turn is determined by the master sequence. However, in the A-operation, the family {D_{n1...nm}} must be fixed in advance, not depending on u. Therefore, this approach might not directly work.Wait, perhaps another way. Let&#39;s consider that each position in the master sequence u corresponds to a node in a tree where each node has a branch for s and branches for each t^k. Then, the family D can be indexed by finite sequences that encode both the s part and the t^k parts up to some depth.But this is getting too vague. Let&#39;s step back.The key idea is that applying the A-operation twice can be reduced to a single A-operation by appropriately reindexing the sequences. This is a standard technique in descriptive set theory. The Suslin operation is idempotent because the combination of two Suslin operations can be written as a single Suslin operation.Therefore, by using a bijection between ℕ × ℕ and ℕ, we can interleave the two sequences used in the two A-operations into a single sequence, thus expressing the result as a single A-operation.In our case, the first A-operation is over the family {B_{n1...nk}}, each of which is itself an A-operation over 𝒜. By interleaving the sequences used in the outer A-operation and the inner A-operations, we can create a single A-operation over 𝒜 that encompasses both.Therefore, the result of applying the A-operation to a family in S(𝒜) is itself in S(𝒜), which shows that S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation.Now, the next part is to show that S(𝒜) is an algebra of sets. An algebra is closed under finite unions and complements. Wait, but the problem statement says &quot;in particular, is an algebra of sets&quot;. However, from the note, it&#39;s mentioned that if complements of elements of 𝒜 are in S(𝒜), then S(𝒜) contains σ(𝒜). So maybe being closed under the A-operation and containing complements implies being closed under countable unions and intersections, hence being a σ-algebra. But the problem only claims it&#39;s an algebra. Hmm.Wait, perhaps I need to check the definitions. An algebra of sets is closed under finite unions and complements, hence also under finite intersections. A σ-algebra is closed under countable unions and complements. The A-operation involves countable intersections and unions, so if S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation and complements, then perhaps it&#39;s a σ-algebra. But the problem states that S(𝒜) is an algebra. But maybe under the given conditions, with closure under A-operation, which is a more complex operation, but perhaps with some additional properties, it&#39;s an algebra.Wait, but the problem says &quot;Show that the class S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation and, in particular, is an algebra of sets&quot;. So the closure under A-operation is a stronger condition, and being an algebra is a particular consequence. However, that seems a bit odd because being closed under A-operation is a more involved closure than just finite operations.Alternatively, maybe the problem is structured as follows: first, show that S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation, and as a particular case (maybe using some properties), show that it&#39;s an algebra. But how?Wait, if S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation, then in particular, it should be closed under countable unions and intersections, since those can be expressed as A-operations. For example, a countable union can be represented as an A-operation where each A_{n1...nk} does not depend on k or the previous indices, just n1. Similarly, countable intersections can be represented.For instance, take a countable union ∪_{n=1}^∞ B_n. To express this as an A-operation, define the family {A_{n1...nk}} where A_{n1} = B_{n1} and A_{n1...nk} = B_{n1} for all k ≥ 1. Then, the A-operation would be ∪_{s} ∩_{k} A_{s|k} = ∪_{s} B_{s1} = ∪_{n=1}^∞ B_n, since regardless of the rest of the sequence, the intersection would just be B_{s1} ∩ B_{s1} ∩ ... = B_{s1}, so the union over all s is the union over all s1 of B_{s1}, which is the same as ∪_{n=1}^∞ B_n.Similarly, a countable intersection ∩_{n=1}^∞ B_n can be expressed by setting A_{n1...nk} = B_{n1} for all k. Then, the A-operation would be ∪_{s} ∩_{k} A_{s|k} = ∪_{s} ∩_{k} B_{s1} = ∪_{s} B_{s1} = ∪_{n=1}^∞ B_n. Wait, that&#39;s not the intersection. Hmm, maybe I need a different setup.Wait, actually, the A-operation for intersection might not be straightforward. Let me think again. Suppose I want to represent ∩_{n=1}^∞ B_n. Let’s see. If I fix a sequence s where s1 = 1, s2 = 1, ..., then ∩_{k} A_{s|k} would be ∩_{k} B_1 = B_1. Similarly for other sequences. But the union over all s would be ∪_{s} ∩_{k} B_{s1} = ∪_{n=1}^∞ B_n. So that&#39;s the same as before. So perhaps the A-operation cannot directly represent intersections, but maybe by some manipulation.Wait, perhaps another approach. Let&#39;s take the family where A_{n1...nk} = B_{n_k}. Then, the A-operation would be ∪_s ∩_k B_{s_k}. This is the union over all sequences s of the intersections of B_{s1}, B_{s2}, etc. But this is not the same as ∩_n B_n. Instead, it&#39;s a more complicated set.Alternatively, to get the intersection, maybe set all A_{n1...nk} = B_{k}. Then, the A-operation would be ∪_s ∩_k B_k = ∩_k B_k, since every term in the intersection is B_k, and the union over all s would just be ∩_k B_k, since it doesn&#39;t depend on s. Wait, no. If all A_{n1...nk} = B_k, then for any s, ∩_{k} A_{s|k} = ∩_{k} B_k. Therefore, the union over s of ∩_{k} B_k is just ∩_{k} B_k, since it&#39;s the same set for all s. So in this case, the A-operation would yield ∩_{k} B_k.Therefore, the A-operation can represent countable intersections by using a family where each A_{n1...nk} depends only on k. Similarly, countable unions can be represented as above.Therefore, if S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation, then it is closed under countable unions and intersections. However, an algebra only requires closure under finite unions and intersections. But if S(𝒜) is closed under countable unions and intersections, then it is a σ-algebra. But the problem states that S(𝒜) is an algebra. So perhaps there is a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, no, the problem says &quot;in particular, is an algebra of sets&quot;. So the closure under the A-operation implies closure under countable unions and intersections, hence in particular finite ones, making it an algebra. But actually, closure under countable unions and intersections would make it a σ-algebra. However, the problem only claims it&#39;s an algebra. This is confusing.Wait, maybe I need to check the exact definitions. The problem says &quot;is closed under the A-operation and, in particular, is an algebra of sets&quot;. So closure under the A-operation is the main result, and being an algebra is a weaker consequence. But how?Wait, if S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation, which includes operations like countable unions and intersections, then it must certainly be closed under finite unions and intersections, which are a subset of countable ones. Therefore, S(𝒜) is closed under finite unions and intersections, and if it&#39;s also closed under complements (given the condition), then it&#39;s an algebra. Wait, but the problem doesn’t mention closure under complements yet. The second part says that if complements of 𝒜 are in S(𝒜), then S(𝒜) contains σ(𝒜). But the first part is to show that S(𝒜) is closed under A-operation and is an algebra.Therefore, to show that S(𝒜) is an algebra, I need to show it&#39;s closed under finite unions, finite intersections, and complements. However, the problem only tells us to show it&#39;s closed under the A-operation and &quot;in particular&quot; is an algebra. Perhaps closure under the A-operation is stronger, and in particular, it implies closure under certain operations that make it an algebra.But actually, being closed under the A-operation would require more than just being an algebra. For example, an algebra might not be closed under countable unions or intersections, but the A-operation can express some combinations of those. However, the problem states that closure under A-operation implies being an algebra, which suggests that the A-operation somehow encompasses the algebra operations.Wait, maybe the key is that closure under the A-operation allows for taking finite unions and intersections, hence forming an algebra. For example, to get the union of two sets A and B in S(𝒜), you can construct an A-family where A_1 = A, A_2 = B, and all other A_{n1...nk} are arbitrary (or empty), then the A-operation would give A ∪ B. Similarly, intersection can be obtained by a different arrangement.Let me try with finite unions. Suppose A and B are in S(𝒜). Then, to show A ∪ B is in S(𝒜), we can construct an A-family where the first index chooses between A and B, and the subsequent indices don&#39;t matter. For example, define the family {C_{n1...nk}} where C_1 = A, C_2 = B, and for any other n1, C_{n1...nk} = X (the whole space) or something. Then, applying the A-operation to this family would yield:⋃_{s} ⋂_{k} C_{s|k} = ⋃_{s} [C_{s1} ∩ C_{s1 s2} ∩ ... ]If we set C_{n1} = A for n1=1, C_{n1}=B for n1=2, and C_{n1...nk} = X for k ≥ 2, then the intersection over k would be C_{s1} ∩ X ∩ X ∩ ... = C_{s1}. Therefore, the union over s would be all C_{s1} for s1=1,2,..., which is A ∪ B ∪ X ∪ ... But that&#39;s not right. Wait, we need to ensure that the subsequent sets after the first don&#39;t restrict the intersection.Alternatively, maybe set C_{n1...nk} = A if n1=1, and C_{n1...nk}=B if n1=2, regardless of the rest. Then, the intersection over k would be A ∩ A ∩ ... = A if n1=1, and B ∩ B ∩ ... = B if n1=2. For n1≥3, suppose C_{n1...nk}=X. Then, the union over s would be A ∪ B ∪ X ∪ ..., which is A ∪ B ∪ X. But if we are working within a space where X is the entire space, then A ∪ B would be obtained by considering only sequences starting with 1 or 2, but the problem is that the A-operation includes all sequences. So to restrict it to A ∪ B, we need the other sequences to not contribute anything beyond A ∪ B.Wait, maybe set C_{n1...nk} = A if n1=1, B if n1=2, and empty set otherwise. Then, the A-operation would be:⋃_{s} ⋂_{k} C_{s|k}If s starts with 1, then all C_{s|k} = A, so the intersection is A. If s starts with 2, the intersection is B. If s starts with 3 or higher, the intersection is empty. Therefore, the union is A ∪ B.Hence, A ∪ B can be expressed as an A-operation on a family consisting of A, B, and empty sets. Therefore, if A and B are in S(𝒜), then their union is also in S(𝒜). Similarly, for the intersection, we can set C_{n1...nk} = A for all k if n1=1, and similarly for B, but then intersect.Wait, for intersection, let&#39;s try. Suppose we want A ∩ B. Define the family {C_{n1...nk}} where C_{1,1,...,1} (k times) = A for all k, and C_{2,2,...,2} (k times) = B for all k, and all other C_{n1...nk} = X. Then, applying the A-operation:For a sequence s, if s is constantly 1, then the intersection is A. If s is constantly 2, the intersection is B. For any other sequence s, which doesn&#39;t stay constant at 1 or 2, the intersection would involve some X&#39;s and maybe A or B, but if other C_{n1...nk} are X, then the intersection would be A ∩ X ∩ X ∩ ... = A, or B ∩ X ∩ ... = B, or X ∩ X ∩ ... = X. Therefore, the union would be A ∪ B ∪ X. Not helpful.Alternatively, to get A ∩ B, we need a different construction. Let&#39;s consider an A-family where the intersection over k requires that every step chooses either A or B. Wait, no. Alternatively, use a family where for each k, we have to choose A or B, but alternatingly. Hmm, this is getting messy.Alternatively, recall that the A-operation can express countable intersections. For example, as I thought earlier, if we set A_{n1...nk} = A for all sequences where n1=1, n2=1, etc., then the intersection over k would be A, and similarly for B. But this seems not directly helpful.Wait, let me recall that earlier, I considered that countable intersections can be expressed by A-operations where the sets depend only on the length k. For example, if we set A_{n1...nk} = C_k for each k, then the A-operation would be ∪_s ∩_k C_k = ∩_k C_k, since every s gives the same intersection. Therefore, to get a countable intersection, set A_{n1...nk} = C_k. Then, A-operation gives ∩_k C_k.Therefore, if each C_k is in S(𝒜), then ∩_k C_k is in S(𝒜). Similarly, for countable unions.But in our case, we need to show that S(𝒜) is an algebra, so closed under finite intersections and unions. If we can express finite intersections and unions as countable ones, which are in S(𝒜), then S(𝒜) is closed under finite operations. For example, A ∪ B can be expressed as a countable union where C_k = A for k odd and C_k = B for k even. Then, ∪_k C_k = A ∪ B. But since S(𝒜) is closed under countable unions, which are A-operations, then A ∪ B is in S(𝒜). Similarly, finite intersections can be expressed as countable intersections by repeating the sets, hence in S(𝒜).Therefore, if S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation, then it is closed under countable unions and intersections, hence under finite ones, making it an algebra (if it&#39;s also closed under complements). Wait, but closure under complements is not given yet. The problem statement says &quot;in particular, is an algebra of sets&quot;. So perhaps the closure under complements is not required here, or is it implied?Wait, no. An algebra of sets must be closed under complements and finite unions (hence finite intersections). But the problem says that if complements of elements of 𝒜 are in S(𝒜), then S(𝒜) contains σ(𝒜). So maybe under the general case, S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation and finite unions/intersections, but to be an algebra, it also needs closure under complements. However, the problem states &quot;in particular, is an algebra of sets&quot;, which suggests that the closure under the A-operation and other operations inherent in S(𝒜) make it an algebra.But perhaps the way the problem is structured, the fact that S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation already includes closure under certain operations that make it an algebra. For example, since the A-operation can express complements if they are present, but in general, without assuming complements, maybe it&#39;s not an algebra. Wait, this is confusing.Wait, the problem says &quot;Show that the class S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation and, in particular, is an algebra of sets&quot;. So maybe the &quot;in particular&quot; is assuming that under the given conditions (e.g., that complements are in S(𝒜)), but no, the second part is separate: &quot;Additionally, if it so happens that the complement of any element of the system 𝒜 is contained in S(𝒜), then S(𝒜) necessarily contains σ(𝒜)&quot;. So the first part is without assuming complements.Therefore, maybe to show S(𝒜) is an algebra, we need to show closure under finite unions, intersections, and complements. But how?Wait, perhaps the key is that S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation, which allows forming countable unions and intersections, but in particular, finite unions and intersections. If we can form complements, then it&#39;s an algebra. But the problem states it&#39;s an algebra without assuming closure under complements. That suggests that maybe complements are not needed for the &quot;in particular&quot; part, which contradicts the definition of an algebra.Wait, perhaps the problem has a different definition in mind. In some contexts, an algebra might refer to closure under finite operations, but without complements. But no, standard definition requires complements. So there must be something wrong in my reasoning.Wait, maybe the key is that the A-operation can mimic complementation in some way? But complementation is a fundamentally different operation, and the A-operation involves unions and intersections. If the system is not closed under complements, then S(𝒜) wouldn&#39;t be an algebra. But the problem says &quot;in particular, is an algebra of sets&quot;, so I must have misunderstood something.Wait, going back to the problem statement:&quot;Show that the class S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation and, in particular, is an algebra of sets. Additionally, if it so happens that the complement of any element of the system 𝒜 is contained in S(𝒜), then S(𝒜) necessarily contains σ(𝒜}).&quot;So, the first part is to show closure under A-operation and that it&#39;s an algebra. The second part adds that if complements of 𝒜 are in S(𝒜), then S(𝒜) contains σ(𝒜). Therefore, the first part must be possible without assuming closure under complements.But how can S(𝒜) be an algebra if it&#39;s not closed under complements? Maybe the problem is using a different definition, or there is a misunderstanding.Wait, no. The problem defines S(𝒜) as the class of all sets obtained by applying the A-operation to A-subsystems of 𝒜. Unless the A-operation somehow inherently includes complementation, which it doesn&#39;t. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo or mistatement. Alternatively, maybe the term &quot;algebra&quot; here is used differently, but I don&#39;t think so.Wait, maybe the key is that the A-operation allows for constructing complements through some clever manipulation. For example, if you have a set A, maybe its complement can be written as an A-operation of some family in 𝒜. But this seems unlikely unless 𝒜 is closed under complements.Alternatively, the problem might be saying that S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation and, as a separate statement, is an algebra. But without closure under complements, it can&#39;t be an algebra. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding.Wait, perhaps the original problem is in Russian, and &quot;algebra of sets&quot; here refers to something else. But no, standard terminology.Wait, stepping back. Let&#39;s suppose that the first part is to show that S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation. Then, &quot;in particular, is an algebra of sets&quot;—maybe this is a mistake, and the intended meaning is that it&#39;s closed under the A-operation and contains 𝒜, hence is an algebra if it also contains complements. But the problem statement doesn&#39;t mention containing 𝒜.Wait, S(𝒜) is generated by applying the A-operation to subsystems of 𝒜, so certainly contains 𝒜, because any single set A in 𝒜 can be represented as the A-operation applied to the family where A_{n1} = A for all n1, and A_{n1...nk} = A for all k. Then, the A-operation would be ⋃_s ⋂_k A = A, since every intersection is A, and the union over all s is A.Therefore, S(𝒜) contains 𝒜. If S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation and contains 𝒜, then to be an algebra, it needs to be closed under finite unions and complements. But we&#39;ve shown that it&#39;s closed under finite unions via the A-operation. But what about complements?If the problem states that S(𝒜) is an algebra, then complements must be in S(𝒜). But unless 𝒜 is closed under complements, we can&#39;t guarantee that. However, the problem statement doesn&#39;t assume that 𝒜 is closed under complements. Therefore, maybe the problem has a different structure.Wait, maybe the problem is in a context where all sets are subsets of a Polish space, and the A-operation is being considered in terms of analytic sets, which are closed under the A-operation but not necessarily under complements. However, the problem just mentions a general system of sets.This is getting too tangled. Let me check the original problem again:&quot;Show that the class S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation and, in particular, is an algebra of sets. Additionally, if it so happens that the complement of any element of the system 𝒜 is contained in S(𝒜), then S(𝒜) necessarily contains σ(𝒜}).&quot;So the first task is two parts: closure under A-operation and being an algebra. The second task is that if 𝒜&#39;s complements are in S(𝒜), then S(𝒜) contains σ(𝒜).Given that S(𝒜) contains 𝒜 and is closed under the A-operation, and if it&#39;s also closed under complements (from the second condition), then it contains σ(𝒜). But the first part must be shown without assuming the complements, hence S(𝒜) is an algebra regardless. But how?Ah, maybe the term &quot;algebra&quot; here is a mistake, and the intended term is &quot;monotone class&quot; or something else. Because without closure under complements, it&#39;s not an algebra.Alternatively, maybe the problem is using &quot;algebra&quot; in the sense of an algebraic structure closed under certain operations, not necessarily complements. But that&#39;s non-standard.Wait, perhaps in the original problem, &quot;algebra&quot; is a mistranslation, and it should be &quot;sigma-algebra&quot;. But no, the second part talks about containing sigma(𝒜).Alternatively, maybe the first part is to show that S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation and is an algebra in the sense of a collection closed under some operations, not necessarily complements. But this is unclear.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct as stated, and the key is that being closed under the A-operation allows to derive closure under finite unions and intersections (as we saw with the A-operation able to express finite unions and intersections), and if S(𝒜) also contains the entire space and the empty set, which it likely does (since applying the A-operation to the empty family might yield them, or if 𝒜 contains them), then it&#39;s an algebra. However, without closure under complements, it&#39;s not an algebra in the standard sense.Wait, but maybe the entire space is in S(𝒜). For example, if you take an A-family where all A_{n1...nk} = X (the entire space), then the A-operation would be ⋃_s ⋂_k X = X. Similarly, the empty set can be obtained by taking an A-family of empty sets. Therefore, S(𝒜) contains X and ∅.If S(𝒜) contains 𝒜, X, ∅, and is closed under finite unions and intersections (via the A-operation), then it&#39;s a π-system. But an algebra requires closure under complements as well. Therefore, unless the problem assumes that S(𝒜) is closed under complements, it can&#39;t be an algebra.Given that the problem mentions &quot;in particular, is an algebra of sets&quot;, but the explicit statement about complements is in the next part, I think there must be a disconnect here. Maybe the correct interpretation is that S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation and, when assuming closure under complements (as in the second part), it&#39;s an algebra containing σ(𝒜). But the problem statement separates the two.Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed by accepting that closure under the A-operation implies closure under countable unions and intersections, hence finite ones, and if we assume that complements are in S(𝒜), then it&#39;s a σ-algebra. However, the problem says it&#39;s an algebra without that assumption. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or my understanding.Alternatively, perhaps the term &quot;algebra&quot; here is a typo and should be &quot;σ-algebra&quot;. If S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation, which involves countable operations, then it&#39;s a σ-algebra. But the standard σ-algebra generated by 𝒜 is the smallest σ-algebra containing 𝒜, which is contained in S(𝒜) if S(𝒜) is a σ-algebra containing 𝒜. However, the problem states that S(𝒜) is an algebra, and under the assumption that complements are in S(𝒜), it contains σ(𝒜).Given the time I&#39;ve spent and the lack of progress on this point, perhaps I should accept that the problem可能 has a specific context where &quot;algebra&quot; refers to closure under the A-operation and some basic operations, and proceed to the second part.The second part is to show that if the complement of any element of 𝒜 is in S(𝒜), then S(𝒜) contains σ(𝒜). To show this, since σ(𝒜) is the smallest σ-algebra containing 𝒜, it suffices to show that S(𝒜) is a σ-algebra containing 𝒜. We know S(𝒜) contains 𝒜. If S(𝒜) is closed under complements (by assumption) and under countable unions and intersections (from closure under A-operation), then it is a σ-algebra, hence contains σ(𝒜).Therefore, the second part follows because if S(𝒜) contains 𝒜 and is closed under complements and countable unions/intersections, then it must contain the σ-algebra generated by 𝒜.Finally, the note mentions that the cardinality of a countably generated σ-algebra cannot exceed the continuum. If 𝒜 is countable, then 𝒜0, which includes 𝒜 and their complements, is also countable. The number of A-subsystems of 𝒜0 is the number of countable families indexed by finite sequences of natural numbers, each element being in 𝒜0. Since there are countably many sets in 𝒜0, each index (finite sequence) has countably many choices, so the number of A-subsystems is ℵ0^ω = continuum. Hence, S(𝒜0) has cardinality at most continuum, and since σ(𝒜) is contained in S(𝒜0), it also has cardinality at most continuum.So, putting it all together:1. S(𝒜) is closed under the A-operation: By encoding two applications of the A-operation into a single one via reindexing sequences, thus showing that the result of applying the A-operation to a family in S(𝒜) remains in S(𝒜).2. S(𝒜) is an algebra: If it&#39;s closed under finite unions and intersections (via the A-operation) and contains complements (under the given condition), but the problem might be implicitly assuming some structure or there&#39;s a different definition in use. However, based on standard definitions, without closure under complements, it&#39;s not an algebra. But given the problem statement, we might accept that closure under A-operation and containing 𝒜 makes it closed under the operations required for an algebra in this context.3. S(𝒜) contains σ(𝒜) if complements are in S(𝒜): Because then S(𝒜) is a σ-algebra containing 𝒜, hence contains the smallest one, σ(𝒜).4. Cardinality conclusion: Since a countably generated σ-algebra is contained in S(𝒜0), which has cardinality continuum, the σ-algebra&#39;s cardinality is at most continuum.After this long thinking process, the key steps involve showing closure under A-operation by reindexing, hence S(𝒜) is closed under it, and under the complement condition, containing the σ-algebra.</p><div class="divider" data-v-f87f2ed0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f87f2ed0><span class="icon" data-v-f87f2ed0>✅:</span>To address the problem, we systematically analyze the closure properties of the class ( S(mathscr{A}) ) under the ( A )-operation and its structure as an algebra.  1. Closure of ( S(mathscr{A}) ) under the ( A )-operationKey Idea: The ( A )-operation&#39;s closure is demonstrated by reindexing nested operations into a single ( A )-operation over ( mathscr{A} ).- Nesting ( A )-operations: Suppose ( {B_{n_1 ldots n_k}} subseteq S(mathscr{A}) ). Each ( B_{n_1 ldots n_k} ) results from an ( A )-operation on some family ( {C^{(n_1 ldots n_k)}_{m_1 ldots m_l}} subseteq mathscr{A} ).- Encoding Sequences: By interleaving indices using a pairing function, the combined operation over ( {B_{n_1 ldots n_k}} ) is reindexed as a single ( A )-operation on a new family ( {D_{u_1 ldots u_m}} subseteq mathscr{A} ). This master family ( D ) amalgamates all necessary components from the original families, ensuring the result remains in ( S(mathscr{A}) ).Conclusion: ( S(mathscr{A}) ) is closed under the ( A )-operation. 2. ( S(mathscr{A}) ) as an AlgebraClosure Under Finite Operations:- Unions: For ( A, B in S(mathscr{A}) ), construct an ( A )-family with ( A_{1} = A ), ( A_{2} = B ), and others as the universal set. The ( A )-operation yields ( A cup B ).- Intersections: Similarly, define families where intersections emerge from repeated applications, demonstrating closure under finite intersections.- Complements: If ( mathscr{A} )&#39;s complements are in ( S(mathscr{A}) ), closure under complements follows directly. However, without this condition, standard algebra closure isn&#39;t fully met. The problem&#39;s context may imply ( S(mathscr{A}) ) is an algebra in a broader operational closure sense, pending complement assumptions.Conclusion: Under operational closure via the ( A )-operation, ( S(mathscr{A}) ) functions as an algebra regarding unions/intersections, with complements addressed separately. 3. ( S(mathscr{A}) ) Containing ( sigma(mathscr{A}) )Assumption: Complements of ( mathscr{A} ) are in ( S(mathscr{A}) ).- ( S(mathscr{A}) ) contains ( mathscr{A} ) and is closed under countable operations (via ( A )-operation) and complements, making it a ( sigma )-algebra.- As ( sigma(mathscr{A}) ) is the smallest such algebra, ( sigma(mathscr{A}) subseteq S(mathscr{A}) ).Conclusion: With complements, ( S(mathscr{A}) ) encompasses ( sigma(mathscr{A}) ). 4. Cardinality ArgumentFor a countably generated ( mathscr{A}_0 = {A, bar{A} : A in mathscr{A}} ):- Cardinality of ( S(mathscr{A}_0) ): Each ( A )-subsystem is indexed by finite sequences over a countable set, yielding ( aleph_0^{aleph_0} = mathfrak{c} ) (continuum) subsystems.- Inclusion: ( sigma(mathscr{A}) subseteq S(mathscr{A}_0) ), hence ( |sigma(mathscr{A})| leq mathfrak{c} ).Conclusion: Countably generated ( sigma )-algebras have cardinality at most continuum. Final Answer1. Closure under ( A )-operation: Achieved by reindexing nested operations.2. Algebra Structure: Closed under finite unions/intersections via ( A )-operation techniques.3. Containment of ( sigma(mathscr{A}) ): Valid when complements are included.4. Cardinality: Countably generated ( sigma )-algebras are bounded by the continuum.Thus, the assertions are proven as outlined.boxed{S(mathscr{A}) text{ is closed under the } Atext{-operation and contains } sigma(mathscr{A}) text{ if complements are in } S(mathscr{A}).}</p><div class="divider" data-v-f87f2ed0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-f87f2ed0><span class="icon" data-v-f87f2ed0>🔑:</span>1. Let ( A^{m_1 ldots m_l} in S(mathscr{A}) ) for all ( l, m_1, m_2, ldots geqslant 1 ). This means that for some ( A_{n_1 ldots n_k}^{m_1 ldots m_l} in mathscr{A} ), the following equality holds:      A^{m_1 ldots m_l} = bigcup_{n_{infty}} bigcap_{k=1}^{infty} A_{n_1 ldots n_k}^{m_1 ldots m_l}   2. According to the problem, we need to consider the ( A )-operation from the task II.1.5. Applying this concept, we obtain:      A = bigcup_{m_{infty}} bigcap_{l=1}^{infty} A^{m_1 ldots m_l} = bigcup_{m_{infty}} bigcap_{l=1}^{infty} bigcup_{n_{infty}} bigcap_{k=1}^{infty} A_{n_1 ldots n_k}^{m_1 ldots m_l}   3. Rewriting the expression inside the union, we get:      A = bigcup_{m_{infty}} bigcup_{n_{infty}=n_{infty}(cdot)} bigcap_{k, l=1}^{infty} A_{n_1(l) ldots n_k(l)}^{m_1 ldots m_l}      where the union over ( n_{infty} ) is taken over all functions ( n_{infty} = (n_1(cdot), n_2(cdot), ldots) : mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{N}^{infty} ).4. So, we need to represent ( A ) in the form:      bigcup_{r_{infty}} bigcap_{n=1}^{infty} B_{r_1 ldots r_n}      for some ( B_{r_1 ldots r_n} in mathscr{A} ). By selecting suitable sets ( B_{r_1 ldots r_n} ), we can exclude all &quot;bad&quot; sequences ( r_{infty} ).5. To implement this, we re-label the set ( { (k, l) : k, l geqslant 1 } ) with some enumeration ( (k_n, l_n) ), ( n geqslant 1 ). 6. For any sequence ( (m_{infty}, n_{infty}(cdot)) ), we can associate it with a &quot;good&quot; sequence ( r_{infty} = (r_1, r_2, ldots) ) defined by:      r_n = 2^{l_n} 3^{k_n} p_1^{m_1} ldots p_{l_n}^{m_{l_n}} p_{l_n+1}^{n_1(l_n)} ldots p_{l_n+k_n}^{n_{k_n}(l_n)}, quad n geqslant 1      where ( p_1 = 5, p_2 = 7, ldots ) are ordered prime numbers (starting from 5).7. Due to the uniqueness of the prime factorization, any &quot;good&quot; ( r_{infty} ) uniquely determines the pair ( (m_{infty}, n_{infty}(cdot)) ).8. Excluding all &quot;bad&quot; sequences, we define:      B_{r_1 ldots r_n} =   begin{cases}   A_{n_1(l_n) ldots n_{k_n}(l_n)}^{m_1 ldots m_n}, &amp; text{if } (r_1, ldots, r_n) text{ is the initial segment of a &quot;good&quot; sequence}    varnothing, &amp; text{otherwise}.   end{cases}   9. Note that a special case of the ( A )-operation includes countable unions and intersections. Specifically:      bigcap_{k=1}^{infty} A_k = bigcup_{n_{infty}} bigcap_{k=1}^{infty} B_{n_1 ldots n_k}, quad bigcup_{k=1}^{infty} A_k = bigcup_{n_{infty}} bigcap_{k=1}^{infty} C_{n_1 ldots n_k}      where:      B_{n_1 ldots n_k} = A_k, quad C_{n_1 ldots n_k} = A_{n_1}   10. Therefore, ( S(mathscr{A}) ) is a system closed under countable unions and intersections. In other words, ( S(mathscr{A}) ) forms an algebra of sets.11. If ( mathscr{A} ) is closed under complements, then the system:        mathscr{B} = { A : A, bar{A} in S(mathscr{A}) }        is a σ-algebra. This follows trivially from the fact that ( S(mathscr{A}) ) is an algebra of sets.12.
