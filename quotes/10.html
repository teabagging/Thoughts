data-v-a05b535f><span class="icon" data-v-a05b535f>🧠:</span>Okay, let&#39;s try to tackle this functional equation problem. The question is to find all functions ( f: mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{N} ) such that ( f(1) &gt; 0 ) and for all ( m, n in mathbb{N} ), the equation ( f(m^{2} + n^{2}) = f(m)^2 + f(n)^2 ) holds. First, I need to recall what functional equations are like. Usually, these problems require substituting specific values for variables and trying to find patterns or recursions. Since the function is defined from natural numbers to natural numbers and has to satisfy this equation for all pairs ( (m, n) ), maybe starting with small values like ( m = 1 ) or ( n = 1 ) would help. Let&#39;s start there.Let me note down the given conditions:1. ( f: mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{N} ), so the function takes positive integers to positive integers.2. ( f(1) &gt; 0 ). Since the codomain is ( mathbb{N} ), which typically starts at 1, this just means ( f(1) geq 1 ).3. For all ( m, n in mathbb{N} ), ( f(m^2 + n^2) = f(m)^2 + f(n)^2 ).So, the functional equation is about preserving the sum of squares in some way. Maybe the function is related to the identity function or some exponential function? Let&#39;s check.First, let&#39;s test if the identity function ( f(k) = k ) works. Then, substituting into the equation:Left-hand side (LHS): ( f(m^2 + n^2) = m^2 + n^2 )Right-hand side (RHS): ( f(m)^2 + f(n)^2 = m^2 + n^2 )So, they are equal. Therefore, ( f(k) = k ) is a solution. But the problem says &quot;determine all functions,&quot; so there might be more solutions. Alternatively, maybe this is the only solution. Let&#39;s see.Another simple function to test is a constant function. Suppose ( f(k) = c ) for all ( k in mathbb{N} ), where ( c ) is a constant in ( mathbb{N} ). Then:LHS: ( f(m^2 + n^2) = c )RHS: ( c^2 + c^2 = 2c^2 )So, we need ( c = 2c^2 ). The solutions to this equation are ( c = 0 ) or ( c = 1/2 ). But ( c ) has to be a natural number, so ( c = 0 ) is the only solution. However, ( f(1) &gt; 0 ), so ( c = 0 ) is invalid. Therefore, constant functions other than zero don&#39;t work, and zero isn&#39;t allowed here. So constant functions are out.Next, maybe linear functions? Suppose ( f(k) = ak + b ). Let&#39;s test this. Let me try ( f(k) = ak ), assuming ( b = 0 ).Then, LHS: ( f(m^2 + n^2) = a(m^2 + n^2) )RHS: ( (a m)^2 + (a n)^2 = a^2(m^2 + n^2) )Setting LHS = RHS: ( a(m^2 + n^2) = a^2(m^2 + n^2) )Assuming ( m^2 + n^2 neq 0 ), which it isn&#39;t in ( mathbb{N} ), so we can divide both sides by ( m^2 + n^2 ):( a = a^2 )Solutions: ( a = 0 ) or ( a = 1 ). Again, ( a = 0 ) gives the zero function, which is invalid because ( f(1) &gt; 0 ). So ( a = 1 ), which is the identity function. So that&#39;s consistent with our previous test.What if the function is quadratic? Suppose ( f(k) = k^2 ). Then:LHS: ( f(m^2 + n^2) = (m^2 + n^2)^2 )RHS: ( (m^2)^2 + (n^2)^2 = m^4 + n^4 )These are not equal unless ( m ) or ( n ) is zero, which they aren&#39;t in ( mathbb{N} ). So that&#39;s not a solution.Alternatively, maybe exponential functions? Suppose ( f(k) = c^k ).Then, LHS: ( c^{m^2 + n^2} )RHS: ( c^{2m} + c^{2n} )These are unlikely to be equal for all ( m, n ). For example, take ( m = n = 1 ):LHS: ( c^{2} )RHS: ( c^{2} + c^{2} = 2c^{2} )So ( c^2 = 2c^2 implies c = 0 ), which is invalid. So exponential functions also don&#39;t work.Hmm. Maybe additive functions? But additive over what? The functional equation isn&#39;t additive; it&#39;s additive in the squares. Wait, the function applied to a sum of squares is the sum of the squares of the function. So it&#39;s a bit like a homomorphism for the operation ( (m, n) mapsto m^2 + n^2 ), but since that operation isn&#39;t closed (the result is just another natural number), it&#39;s not a standard algebraic structure. So perhaps the function preserves squares in some way?Alternatively, maybe we can use induction. Let&#39;s see. Let me try small values.First, compute ( f(1) ). We know ( f(1) &gt; 0 ), so ( f(1) geq 1 ).What is ( f(2) )? Let&#39;s see. How can we express 2 as a sum of squares? 1^2 + 1^2 = 2. So:( f(2) = f(1)^2 + f(1)^2 = 2f(1)^2 )So, ( f(2) = 2f(1)^2 ). Since ( f(1) geq 1 ), ( f(2) ) is at least 2*1 = 2.Next, ( f(3) ). Hmm, how to get 3 as a sum of two squares. Wait, 3 cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares. Because 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, 1^2 + 2^2 = 5. So 3 cannot be written as a sum of two squares. Therefore, the functional equation doesn&#39;t directly give us ( f(3) ). Similarly, 4 can be written as 2^2 + 0^2, but 0 isn&#39;t a natural number. Wait, natural numbers start at 1, right? So 4 cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares of natural numbers? Wait, 2^2 + 0^2, but 0 isn&#39;t in ( mathbb{N} ). So 4 can only be written as 2^2 + 0^2 if 0 is allowed, but since m and n are in ( mathbb{N} ), 4 cannot be written as a sum of two squares of natural numbers. Wait, but 2^2 + 0^2 is 4, but n has to be at least 1. Therefore, 4 cannot be written as a sum of two squares in ( mathbb{N} ). Similarly, 5 can be written as 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5.Wait, so starting from m and n in ( mathbb{N} ), the numbers that can be expressed as a sum of two squares are 2 (1+1), 5 (1+4), 8 (4+4), 10 (1+9), 13 (9+4), etc. So, numbers like 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, etc., can&#39;t be expressed as a sum of two squares of natural numbers.Therefore, the functional equation only gives us values for numbers that can be expressed as a sum of two squares. For numbers that cannot be expressed as such, the equation doesn&#39;t provide direct constraints. However, the function is defined for all natural numbers, so we need to find a function that is consistent for those expressible as sums of squares and also defined for others in a way that doesn&#39;t conflict.But maybe the function is determined entirely by the values on the numbers that are sums of squares, and the other values can be arbitrary? But the problem states &quot;for all (m, n) in N^2&quot;, so the equation must hold whenever m^2 + n^2 is a natural number, which it always is. However, the function f is defined for all natural numbers, but the equation only relates f at the sum m^2 + n^2 to the values at m and n.Therefore, the constraints are only on the values of f at numbers that can be written as a sum of two squares. For numbers that cannot be written as a sum of two squares, there are no direct constraints from the equation. However, since the function must be consistent for all m and n, even if m^2 + n^2 is not a sum of two squares, but wait, m and n are any natural numbers, so m^2 + n^2 is just another natural number, regardless of whether it can be written as a sum of two squares. Wait, no, m^2 + n^2 is by definition a sum of two squares. So every number that can be written as a sum of two squares will have f(k) = f(m)^2 + f(n)^2 for any pair (m, n) such that k = m^2 + n^2. But some numbers can be written as a sum of squares in multiple ways, so f(k) must be equal to all possible combinations of f(m)^2 + f(n)^2 for all decompositions of k into m^2 + n^2. Therefore, f(k) must be consistent across all such decompositions.For example, take k = 25. 25 can be written as 3^2 + 4^2 or 5^2 + 0^2 (but 0 isn&#39;t allowed). So, in natural numbers starting at 1, 25 = 3^2 + 4^2. Therefore, f(25) = f(3)^2 + f(4)^2. But if there are multiple representations, the function must satisfy all of them.Wait, but 50 can be written as 1^2 + 7^2 = 5^2 + 5^2. So, f(50) = f(1)^2 + f(7)^2 = f(5)^2 + f(5)^2. Therefore, the function must satisfy f(1)^2 + f(7)^2 = 2f(5)^2. So, if there are multiple representations, the function has to satisfy such equations. So, this could impose additional constraints on f.But since we&#39;re dealing with natural numbers, maybe the function is uniquely determined once we fix f(1). Let&#39;s see.Starting with f(1). Let&#39;s denote ( a = f(1) ). Then, as we saw earlier, f(2) = 2a².Now, f(5): 5 = 1² + 2², so f(5) = f(1)² + f(2)² = a² + (2a²)² = a² + 4a⁴.But wait, f(5) must be a natural number. So, 4a⁴ + a² must be a natural number, which it is as long as a is a natural number. But this seems complicated. Wait, if f is the identity function, then f(5) = 5. Let&#39;s check:If a = 1, then f(5) = 1 + 4(1)^4 = 1 + 4 = 5. So that works. So the identity function satisfies this.But if a is something else, say a = 2, then f(1) = 2, f(2) = 2*(2)^2 = 8. Then f(5) = (2)^2 + (8)^2 = 4 + 64 = 68. Then f(5) would have to be 68. Then, let&#39;s check another expression for 5. Wait, 5 can only be expressed as 1^2 + 2^2 in natural numbers. So there&#39;s only one decomposition, so f(5) is uniquely determined once f(1) and f(2) are fixed. Then, moving on, f(25) would be f(3)^2 + f(4)^2. Wait, but to compute f(3) and f(4), we need to figure out how to express them as sums of squares. But 3 cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares, so f(3) is not directly determined by the functional equation. Similarly, f(4) is not determined because 4 cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares of natural numbers.Wait, hold on. 4 can be written as 2² + 0², but 0 is not in ( mathbb{N} ). So 4 cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares of natural numbers. Therefore, f(4) is not determined by the functional equation. Similarly, f(3) is not determined. So, if the function is not determined for these values, how can we proceed?This suggests that maybe the function is only constrained on numbers that can be expressed as sums of two squares, and the other values can be arbitrary? But the problem states that the function is defined for all natural numbers, so we need to find f such that for any m, n, when you plug m² + n² into f, it equals f(m)² + f(n)². But for numbers that cannot be written as a sum of two squares, there&#39;s no constraint from the equation. However, such numbers can still be part of other sums. For example, take m = 3 and n = 4, then m² + n² = 9 + 16 = 25, so f(25) = f(3)² + f(4)². But since 25 can also be written as 0² + 5² (but 0 not allowed) or other combinations, but in natural numbers, 25 = 3² + 4² only. So, f(25) = f(3)² + f(4)². However, if we don&#39;t have constraints on f(3) and f(4), then f(25) could be arbitrary? But wait, no, because if we take m = 5 and n = 0, but 0 is not allowed. So, if we stick strictly to natural numbers starting at 1, then for 25, the only decomposition is 3² + 4². Therefore, f(25) is determined once f(3) and f(4) are known. But f(3) and f(4) are not determined by the functional equation because 3 and 4 cannot be written as sums of two squares. Therefore, unless there are other constraints, f(3) and f(4) can be arbitrary, leading to different possible f(25). But the problem states that the equation must hold for all m, n in ( mathbb{N} ). So, if f(3) and f(4) are arbitrary, then f(25) is determined by them. However, when we consider m=5 and n= something else, but 5 itself is expressible as 1² + 2², so f(5) is already determined by f(1) and f(2). Wait, but how does that interact with f(25)?Wait, 25 can also be achieved by m=5 and n=0, but 0 is excluded. Alternatively, m=5 and n= something else? 5² + n² = 25 + n². For that to be 25, n must be 0. So no, in natural numbers starting at 1, 25 can only be written as 3² + 4². Therefore, f(25) is determined by f(3) and f(4). However, since f(3) and f(4) are not determined by the functional equation, unless there&#39;s another way to express 3 or 4 as sums of squares, which there isn&#39;t, they remain free variables. But this would imply that there are multiple solutions depending on the choice of f(3), f(4), etc. But the problem says &quot;determine all functions&quot;, so maybe there are infinitely many solutions? But the problem also specifies that f(1) &gt; 0, which is already satisfied if f(1) is a natural number.But wait, the problem is from the 1998 IMO Shortlist, and usually, such problems have unique solutions, often the identity function. So perhaps despite the apparent freedom, the constraints actually force the function to be the identity. Let&#39;s see.Suppose we assume f is the identity function. Then, as checked before, it works. Now, is there another function that satisfies the conditions?Suppose there exists some k where f(k) ≠ k. Let&#39;s see if that leads to a contradiction.Let me consider starting with f(1) = a. Then f(2) = 2a². Let&#39;s suppose a = 1, which gives f(2) = 2. Then f(5) = f(1)² + f(2)² = 1 + 4 = 5. Then f(25) = f(3)² + f(4)². But if f(3) and f(4) are arbitrary, then f(25) could be different. But if we need consistency, maybe f(25) can also be expressed through other decompositions. Wait, but in natural numbers, 25 can only be expressed as 3² + 4². So unless there&#39;s another way, which there isn&#39;t, f(25) is determined by f(3) and f(4). If we don&#39;t have constraints on f(3) and f(4), then f(25) can be arbitrary. But maybe when considering higher numbers, we might get constraints.Alternatively, perhaps all numbers can be built up through sums of squares in some way that forces f(n) = n. Let&#39;s try to see.Suppose we use induction. Let&#39;s assume that for all numbers up to k, f(n) = n holds, then show it holds for k+1. But induction might not work straightforwardly here because not all numbers can be written as a sum of two squares. However, maybe we can use the numbers that can be written as sums of squares to propagate the induction.Alternatively, perhaps f(n) = n is the only solution because the functional equation enforces multiplicative or additive properties that only the identity function satisfies.Wait, let&#39;s think recursively. For numbers that can be written as a sum of squares, their f-values are determined by smaller numbers. For numbers that cannot, their f-values are free. But if we require that the function is consistent for all possible representations, maybe this forces the free variables to align with the identity function.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to see what happens if we set f(1) = 1, then f(2) = 2*1² = 2. Then f(5) = 1² + 2² = 5. Then f(25) = f(3)² + f(4)². If we set f(3) = 3 and f(4) = 4, then f(25) = 9 + 16 = 25, which is consistent. But if we set f(3) and f(4) to something else, say f(3) = 1 and f(4) = 1, then f(25) = 1 + 1 = 2, which would conflict when considering 25 as part of another sum. For example, take m=5 and n=2: m² + n² = 25 + 4 = 29. Then f(29) = f(5)² + f(2)² = 25 + 4 = 29. If f(25) = 2, then when expressing 29 as 25 + 4, f(29) should also be equal to f(5)^2 + f(2)^2 = 25 + 4 = 29, which is consistent. But if we have another decomposition of 29, say 29 = 16 + 13 (which isn&#39;t a sum of squares), but 29 itself can&#39;t be written as a sum of two squares in natural numbers. Wait, 29 = 2² + 5² = 4 + 25, so actually, f(29) should also equal f(2)^2 + f(5)^2 = 4 + 25 = 29. So regardless of how we decompose 29, it has to equal the sum of the squares of f at those components. But if f(25) was set to 2, then when decomposing 25 as 3² + 4², we get f(25) = f(3)^2 + f(4)^2. If we set f(3) = 1 and f(4) = 1, then f(25) = 1 + 1 = 2, but then when using 25 in another sum, like 25 + 4 = 29, we have f(29) = f(25)^2 + f(2)^2 = 2² + 2² = 4 + 4 = 8, which conflicts with the other decomposition f(2)^2 + f(5)^2 = 4 + 25 = 29. So this inconsistency shows that we can&#39;t set f(25) to 2; it must be 25. Therefore, if we set f(3) and f(4) such that f(3)^2 + f(4)^2 = 25, then the only natural number solutions are f(3)=3, f(4)=4 or permutations? Wait, 25 can be written as 3² + 4², 5² + 0² (invalid), or 0² + 5² (invalid). So in natural numbers, the only decomposition is 3² + 4². Therefore, f(25) = f(3)^2 + f(4)^2. For this to equal 25 (to be consistent with f(29) = 29), we need f(3)^2 + f(4)^2 = 25. The natural number solutions to this equation are (3,4), (4,3), (5,0), (0,5), but since f maps to natural numbers, 0 is excluded. Therefore, the only solutions are f(3)=3 and f(4)=4 or vice versa. But if we assume f is strictly increasing or something, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify that. However, if f(3) = 4 and f(4) = 3, then let&#39;s see if that causes any issues.Suppose f(3) = 4 and f(4) = 3. Then f(25) = 16 + 9 = 25, which is okay. Then, let&#39;s check f(5) = 1² + 2² = 1 + 4 = 5. Then, if we take m=3 and n=4, m² + n² = 9 + 16 = 25, so f(25)=25, which works. Now, let&#39;s see if there&#39;s another constraint. For example, take m=3 and n=1: 9 + 1 = 10. So f(10) = f(3)^2 + f(1)^2 = 16 + 1 = 17. But 10 can also be written as 1² + 3², same as above, so f(10) = 17. Alternatively, 10 can be written as 10= other squares? 10= 2² + sqrt(6)^2, but sqrt(6) isn&#39;t natural. So in natural numbers, 10 can only be written as 1² + 3². Therefore, f(10) is determined by f(1) and f(3). Since f(3) is 4, f(10)=17. But if we take m=1 and n=3, same result. Now, let&#39;s check if this affects other numbers. For example, 17 can be written as 1² + 4²=1 + 16=17. So f(17) = f(1)^2 + f(4)^2 = 1 + 9 = 10. Wait, but f(17)=10? Then, if we take m=4 and n=1, we have 16 + 1 =17, so f(17) = f(4)^2 + f(1)^2=9 +1=10. But then, 17 can also be written as, say, 17= other squares? 17= 9 + 8, but 8 isn&#39;t a square. 17= 16 +1, which is 4² +1², already considered. So f(17)=10. Then, if we take m=17 and n= any number, but 17² +n² is a large number, maybe not affecting lower numbers. However, if we consider that f(17)=10, then when 17 is part of another sum, it affects the value. For example, m=17 and n= something: 17² + n² = 289 + n². Then f(289 + n²) = f(17)^2 + f(n)^2 = 10² + f(n)^2 = 100 + f(n)^2. But unless 289 + n² can be written in another way, perhaps there&#39;s no conflict. But now, if we proceed with this altered function where f(3)=4, f(4)=3, f(10)=17, f(17)=10, and so on, is this function consistent with all equations? It seems complicated, but perhaps inconsistencies arise. Let&#39;s check another value. Take m=2 and n=1: 4 +1=5. So f(5)=f(2)^2 +f(1)^2=4 +1=5, which is okay. Then m=2 and n=2: 4 +4=8. So f(8)=f(2)^2 +f(2)^2=4 +4=8. Then m=2 and n=5: 4 +25=29. So f(29)=f(2)^2 +f(5)^2=4 +25=29. Which is consistent with earlier.But if f(3)=4, then m=3 and n=2: 9 +4=13. So f(13)=f(3)^2 +f(2)^2=16 +4=20. Then, 13 can also be written as 2² + 3², same as before. So f(13)=20. Then, check if 20 can be written as a sum of squares. 20=16 +4=4² +2². So f(20)=f(4)^2 +f(2)^2=9 +4=13. Then, m=20 and n= something: 20² +n²=400 +n², f(400 +n²)=f(20)^2 +f(n)^2=13² +f(n)^2=169 +f(n)^2. But 400 +n² can also be written as other sums, but unless there&#39;s another decomposition, it&#39;s okay. Now, notice that f(13)=20 and f(20)=13. Then, if we take m=13 and n=20: 169 +400=569. So f(569)=f(13)^2 +f(20)^2=400 +169=569. So that works. But does this lead to a contradiction somewhere? Let&#39;s check m=3 and n=4: 9 +16=25, f(25)=16 +9=25. That&#39;s okay. Then m=5 and n=2: 25 +4=29, f(29)=25 +4=29. m=5 and n=5: 25 +25=50. So f(50)=f(5)^2 +f(5)^2=25 +25=50. Then, 50 can also be written as 1² +7²=1 +49=50. So f(50)=f(1)^2 +f(7)^2=1 +f(7)^2. So, 50=1 +f(7)^2. Therefore, f(7)^2=49, so f(7)=7. Therefore, even if we set f(3)=4 and f(4)=3, we still get f(7)=7. Because 50 is forced to be 50, so f(7) must be 7. So here&#39;s a constraint.Similarly, 50 can also be written as 5² +5², but that gives f(50)=2f(5)^2=2*25=50, which is consistent. So f(7)=7 is enforced. Then, moving up, m=7 and n=1: 49 +1=50. So f(50)=f(7)^2 +f(1)^2=49 +1=50, which is consistent. So f(7) must be 7.But wait, originally, we had set f(3)=4 and f(4)=3 arbitrarily, but then f(7)=7 is enforced. Let&#39;s see if other values get enforced. For example, take m=3 and n=5: 9 +25=34. So f(34)=f(3)^2 +f(5)^2=16 +25=41. Then, 34 can also be written as other sums of squares? 34=25 +9=5² +3², which is the same as above, so no other decompositions. Therefore, f(34)=41. Then, m=34 and n= any number: 34² +n²=1156 +n², which is a large number, but f(1156 +n²)=41² +f(n)^2. Unless that number can be written as another sum of squares, no conflict.But let&#39;s check another number. Take m=7 and n=1: 49 +1=50, which is handled. m=7 and n=2: 49 +4=53. Then f(53)=f(7)^2 +f(2)^2=49 +4=53. Then, 53 can also be written as 49 +4, same as above. So f(53)=53. Then m=7 and n=5: 49 +25=74. So f(74)=f(7)^2 +f(5)^2=49 +25=74. Then, 74= other sums? 64 +10=8² + sqrt(10)^2, which isn&#39;t natural. 25 +49=5² +7², same as above. So no conflict. Therefore, f(74)=74.Now, let&#39;s check m=7 and n=3: 49 +9=58. Then f(58)=f(7)^2 +f(3)^2=49 +16=65. But 58 can also be written as other sums? 58=49 +9=7² +3², which is already considered. Or 25 +33, which aren&#39;t squares. So no other decomposition. So f(58)=65. Then, if we take m=58 and n= something, but that&#39;s getting too large. However, notice that even though we set f(3)=4 and f(4)=3, f(7)=7 is forced, and subsequently, other values like f(50)=50, f(53)=53, f(74)=74, f(58)=65 (which isn&#39;t 58). Wait, f(58)=65 ≠58. That&#39;s a problem. Because if we assume the function should satisfy f(k)=k for all k, but here, f(58)=65. However, the problem doesn&#39;t state that the function has to be injective or surjective, only that it maps naturals to naturals with f(1)&gt;0. So technically, f(58)=65 is allowed. But the problem is to find all such functions. So if there&#39;s a function where f(3)=4, f(4)=3, leading to f(58)=65, does this function satisfy all the given equations?Wait, let&#39;s verify. For m=3 and n=7, 9 + 49 =58. So f(58)=f(3)^2 +f(7)^2=16 +49=65. But 58 can also be written as, say, m=1 and n= sqrt(57), which isn&#39;t natural. So no other decomposition. Therefore, f(58)=65 is acceptable under the functional equation because there&#39;s no other way to write 58 as a sum of two squares of natural numbers. Therefore, the function can take the value 65 at 58. However, let&#39;s check if this causes any contradictions down the line. For example, take m=58 and n= any number. Let&#39;s pick n=1: 58² +1=3364 +1=3365. Then f(3365)=f(58)^2 +f(1)^2=65² +1=4225 +1=4226. But 3365 can also be written as other sums of squares. For example, 3364=58², so 3365=58² +1², which is the same as above. Alternatively, check if 3365 can be expressed as another sum of squares. Let&#39;s see: sqrt(3365) ≈58.01, so the nearest square below 3365 is 58²=3364. Therefore, 3365=58² +1². Alternatively, check if there&#39;s another pair a,b where a² +b²=3365. For example, 3365 divided by 5 is 673, which is a prime. 673 mod 4 is 1, so it can be expressed as a sum of two squares. Therefore, 3365=5*673=5*(a² +b²). Therefore, 3365 can be expressed as (a*sqrt(5))² + (b*sqrt(5))², but since sqrt(5) isn&#39;t natural, this doesn&#39;t help. Alternatively, perhaps 3365= c² + d² where c and d are natural numbers. Let&#39;s check:Find integers c,d such that c² + d² =3365. Let&#39;s try c=58: 58²=3364, so d=1. That&#39;s the same as before. Next, c=57: 57²=3249, 3365-3249=116, which is not a square. c=56: 56²=3136, 3365-3136=229, not a square. c=55: 3025, 3365-3025=340, not a square. Similarly, c=54: 2916, 3365-2916=449, not a square. c=53:2809, 3365-2809=556, not a square. Continuing down, it&#39;s unlikely. So, the only decomposition is 58² +1². Therefore, f(3365)=65² +1=4226, which is acceptable. So no contradiction here.But then, the function can indeed take non-identity values for some numbers, as long as the functional equation is satisfied. However, this seems to depend on the fact that certain numbers can&#39;t be expressed as sums of squares in multiple ways, allowing some degrees of freedom. But earlier, when we set f(3)=4 and f(4)=3, this forced f(25)=25, which was okay, and also forced f(7)=7, which then forced other values like f(50)=50, f(53)=53, etc. However, in this process, we still ended up with many values where f(k)=k, even though we started with f(3)=4 and f(4)=3. Perhaps this suggests that the non-identity assignments create a sort of inconsistency in the long run, but in our check up to f(58)=65, it seemed consistent.Wait, but let&#39;s check another number. Take m=5 and n=5: 25 +25=50. So f(50)=f(5)^2 +f(5)^2=25 +25=50, which is consistent with the other expression of 50=1² +7² giving f(50)=1 +49=50. So even with f(7)=7, which was forced, this holds. Now, what about m=5 and n=7:25 +49=74. Then f(74)=f(5)^2 +f(7)^2=25 +49=74. Also okay. But here&#39;s a thought: if we follow the chain of dependencies, starting from f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(5)=5, f(7)=7, f(25)=25, f(50)=50, etc., these are all forced to be identity. The only place we had freedom was with f(3) and f(4), which aren&#39;t part of any sum-of-squares decomposition except for their own contributions. But even then, changing f(3) and f(4) affects numbers like f(25), which then affects numbers like f(29) and f(58), but as long as those numbers are only expressible in one way, there&#39;s no contradiction. However, if a number can be expressed in two different ways as sums of squares, then changing f(3) or f(4) could lead to a contradiction. For example, consider the number 25. If 25 could be expressed in two different ways, then f(25) would have to satisfy two equations, potentially constraining f(3) and f(4). But since 25 can only be expressed as 3² +4² in natural numbers, there&#39;s only one equation for f(25). Therefore, changing f(3) and f(4) doesn&#39;t create a conflict for f(25), but it might create conflicts downstream when those numbers are used in other sums.Wait, let&#39;s try to find a number that can be expressed as a sum of squares in two different ways, involving both free variables and forced variables. For example, take the number 50. 50=1² +7² and 5² +5². Earlier, we saw that f(50) must be equal to both 1² +f(7)^2 and 2*f(5)^2. If we had set f(7) to something other than 7, this would create a conflict. But in our case, when we set f(3)=4, f(4)=3, we found that f(7)=7 was forced because 50=1² +7² requires f(7)=7. Therefore, even if we mess with f(3) and f(4), the function forces f(7)=7. Similarly, other numbers might force f(k)=k.Another example: take 65. 65=1² +8²=4² +7². So f(65)=f(1)^2 +f(8)^2 and also f(65)=f(4)^2 +f(7)^2. If we set f(4)=3 and f(7)=7, then f(65)=3² +7²=9 +49=58. But f(65) should also equal f(1)^2 +f(8)^2=1 +f(8)^2. Therefore, 1 +f(8)^2=58, so f(8)^2=57. But 57 is not a perfect square, so f(8) would have to be a natural number such that its square is 57, which is impossible. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction. Ah! Here&#39;s the contradiction. So if we set f(3)=4, f(4)=3, then f(7)=7 is forced. Then, when considering 65=4² +7², f(65)=3² +7²=9 +49=58. But 65 can also be written as 1² +8²=1 +64. Therefore, f(65)=f(1)^2 +f(8)^2=1 +f(8)^2. Therefore, we have 1 +f(8)^2=58 ⇒ f(8)^2=57. But 57 isn&#39;t a perfect square, so there&#39;s no natural number f(8) satisfying this. Therefore, our assumption that f(3)=4 and f(4)=3 leads to a contradiction because f(8) would have to satisfy an impossible equation. Therefore, such a function cannot exist. Therefore, this implies that f(3) and f(4) cannot be chosen arbitrarily; they must satisfy the condition that when 65 is expressed as both 4² +7² and 1² +8², the resulting equations for f(65) must agree. Since f(7)=7 is forced (from the case of 50), we have:From 4² +7²: f(65) = f(4)^2 + f(7)^2 = f(4)^2 + 49From 1² +8²: f(65) = f(1)^2 + f(8)^2 = 1 + f(8)^2Therefore, equating the two:f(4)^2 + 49 = 1 + f(8)^2 ⇒ f(4)^2 - f(8)^2 = -48 ⇒ (f(4) - f(8))(f(4) + f(8)) = -48Since f(4) and f(8) are natural numbers, f(4) - f(8) and f(4) + f(8) are integers. Also, f(4) + f(8) &gt; f(4) - f(8). The product is -48, which is negative, so one factor is positive and the other is negative. Since f(4) and f(8) are natural numbers, f(4) + f(8) is positive, so f(4) - f(8) must be negative. Therefore, f(8) &gt; f(4). Let&#39;s write f(8) = f(4) + k, where k is a positive integer.Then,(f(4) - (f(4) + k))(2f(4) + k) = -48 ⇒ (-k)(2f(4) + k) = -48 ⇒ k(2f(4) + k) = 48We need to find positive integers k and f(4) such that k(2f(4) + k) = 48.Let&#39;s factor 48 to find possible pairs (k, 2f(4) + k):48 can be factored as:1 × 482 × 243 × 164 × 126 × 8Since k divides 48 and k &lt; 2f(4) + k (since f(4) is positive), we can check each factorization:1. k=1, 2f(4) +1=48 ⇒ 2f(4)=47 ⇒ f(4)=23.5 → not natural.2. k=2, 2f(4) +2=24 ⇒ 2f(4)=22 ⇒ f(4)=11. Then f(8)=11 +2=13. Check if this works:From above, f(4)=11, f(8)=13.Then f(65) = f(4)^2 +49=121 +49=170Also, f(65)=1 + f(8)^2=1 +169=170. So this works. Wait, but f(4)=11 and f(8)=13. But earlier, we had f(8)=8 in the identity function. However, if f(4)=11 and f(8)=13, this leads to a consistent f(65)=170. But then, we need to check if this leads to other contradictions.Wait, let&#39;s see. If f(4)=11, then f(2)=2*1²=2. Then f(5)=1² +2²=1 +4=5. Then f(25)=f(3)^2 + f(4)^2. But wait, we set f(3)=? Previously, we had a contradiction when setting f(3)=4, but in this case, let&#39;s re-examine.Wait, we assumed f(1)=1, leading to f(2)=2. Then, to compute f(5)=1² +2²=5, which is okay. Then, f(25)=f(3)^2 + f(4)^2. If f(4)=11, then f(25)=f(3)^2 +121. Also, since 25=3² +4², and we have f(25)=25 if the identity function holds, but if f(25)=25, then f(3)^2 +121=25 ⇒ f(3)^2= -96, which is impossible. Therefore, this is a problem. Therefore, even though f(4)=11 and f(8)=13 satisfy the equation for f(65), it creates a contradiction for f(25). Therefore, this suggests that our assumption f(4)=11 is invalid because f(25) must be a natural number, but f(3)^2 would have to be negative. Therefore, there&#39;s no solution with k=2.Next factorization:3. k=3, 2f(4) +3=16 ⇒ 2f(4)=13 ⇒ f(4)=6.5 → not natural.4. k=4, 2f(4) +4=12 ⇒ 2f(4)=8 ⇒ f(4)=4. Then f(8)=4 +4=8. Check:f(65)=f(4)^2 +49=16 +49=65Also, f(65)=1 +f(8)^2=1 +64=65. So this works. Therefore, if f(4)=4 and f(8)=8, this satisfies the equation. This is exactly the identity function case. So f(4)=4 and f(8)=8. Another factorization:5. k=6, 2f(4) +6=8 ⇒ 2f(4)=2 ⇒ f(4)=1. Then f(8)=1 +6=7. Check:f(65)=f(4)^2 +49=1 +49=50And f(65)=1 +f(8)^2=1 +49=50. So f(65)=50. But in the identity function, f(65)=65, which conflicts. However, according to this, f(65)=50. But then, 65 can also be written as other sums, but in natural numbers, only 1² +8² and 4² +7². So, if f(4)=1 and f(8)=7, then:From 4² +7²: f(65)=f(4)^2 +f(7)^2=1 +f(7)^2From 1² +8²: f(65)=1 +f(8)^2=1 +49=50Therefore, 1 +f(7)^2=50 ⇒ f(7)^2=49 ⇒ f(7)=7. Then, f(65)=1 +49=50. But if we use m=7 and n=4:7² +4²=49 +16=65, then f(65)=f(7)^2 +f(4)^2=49 +1=50. So this is consistent. However, now check if this causes contradictions elsewhere.For example, f(7)=7. Then, 50=1² +7², so f(50)=1 +49=50, which matches the identity function. Also, 25=3² +4², so f(25)=f(3)^2 +f(4)^2. But f(4)=1, so f(25)=f(3)^2 +1. However, 25 can also be written as 5² +0² (invalid). So, there&#39;s no other decomposition. Therefore, f(25)=f(3)^2 +1. But if we set f(3)=?Wait, we haven&#39;t set f(3) yet. If f(4)=1, then we need to determine f(3). But 3 cannot be written as a sum of two squares, so f(3) is arbitrary. However, when 25=3² +4², f(25)=f(3)^2 +1. But f(25) is also part of other equations. For example, 25 + 25=50, so f(50)=f(25)^2 +f(25)^2=2f(25)^2. But we already have f(50)=50. Therefore:50=2f(25)^2 ⇒ f(25)^2=25 ⇒ f(25)=5.But f(25)=f(3)^2 +1=5 ⇒ f(3)^2=4 ⇒ f(3)=2. So, f(3)=2.Therefore, if we set f(4)=1, then f(3)=2 and f(25)=5. Let&#39;s see if this leads to contradictions.Take m=3 and n=4:9 +16=25. So f(25)=f(3)^2 +f(4)^2=4 +1=5, which is okay. Then, m=5 and n=2:25 +4=29. So f(29)=f(5)^2 +f(2)^2=25 +4=29. But in the identity function, f(29)=29, which matches. However, in this altered function, f(5)=5 (since 5=1² +2², f(5)=1 +4=5), so f(29)=25 +4=29, which is consistent. Next, m=3 and n=5:9 +25=34. So f(34)=f(3)^2 +f(5)^2=4 +25=29. But 34 can also be written as 5² +3², same as above. So f(34)=29. Then, m=29 and n=5:29² +5²=841 +25=866. So f(866)=f(29)^2 +f(5)^2=841 +25=866, which is consistent. But wait, f(34)=29. If we take m=34 and n=1:34² +1=1156 +1=1157. Then f(1157)=f(34)^2 +f(1)^2=841 +1=842. But 1157 can also be written as other sums of squares. Let&#39;s check if it can be expressed as another sum. sqrt(1157)≈34.01, so 34²=1156. Therefore, 1157=34² +1². So, f(1157)=f(34)^2 +f(1)^2=841 +1=842. No other decompositions, so this is okay. But if we check m=34 and n= any other number, say n=2:34² +4=1156 +4=1160. So f(1160)=f(34)^2 +f(2)^2=841 +4=845. Then, check if 1160 can be written as another sum. For example, 1160= 32² + 14²=1024 +196=1220, which is too big. 30²=900, 1160-900=260, which is not a square. 28²=784, 1160-784=376, not a square. 24²=576, 1160-576=584, not a square. So likely, 1160=34² +2² only. So f(1160)=845 is okay. However, let&#39;s check if 29 can be written as another sum. 29=25 +4=5² +2², so f(29)=25 +4=29, which is consistent. Also, 29= other sums? 16 +13, not squares. So only one decomposition. But now, let&#39;s look at f(25)=5. If 25=5², but f(25)=5, which is consistent with the identity function for 5, but in reality, 25 is mapped to 5. Wait, but 25 is not 5, so this is a conflict if there&#39;s a decomposition involving 25. For example, take m=25 and n= any number. For example, m=25 and n=1:625 +1=626. So f(626)=f(25)^2 +f(1)^2=25 +1=26. But 626 can also be written as 25² +1², same as above. So f(626)=26. However, 626=25² +1², but in the identity function, f(626)=626, but here it&#39;s 26. That&#39;s a problem because 626 is a natural number, and f(626) should be a natural number. 26 is a natural number, so technically, it&#39;s allowed. But does this lead to any contradictions?Wait, but f(626)=26. Then, if we take m=26 and n= any number, say n=1:26² +1=676 +1=677. Then f(677)=f(26)^2 +f(1)^2. But we don&#39;t know f(26) yet. Since 26 cannot be written as a sum of two squares in natural numbers (26=25 +1=5² +1², but wait, 5² +1²=25 +1=26. So, f(26)=f(5)^2 +f(1)^2=25 +1=26. Therefore, f(26)=26. Then f(677)=26² +1=676 +1=677. Which is consistent with the identity function. However, in our altered function, f(626)=26. But when m=25 and n=1, we have f(626)=26, and when m=26 and n=1, we have f(677)=677. So no direct contradiction here. But this is strange because f(25)=5, which is different from the identity function. However, the problem doesn&#39;t require the function to be injective or surjective, only that it maps naturals to naturals and satisfies the equation. So technically, this function is allowed. But let&#39;s check another decomposition. Take m=5 and n=25:25 +625=650. So f(650)=f(5)^2 +f(25)^2=25 +25=50. But 650 can also be written as 25² +5²=625 +25=650, same as above. So f(650)=50. But 650= other sums? For example, 650= 25² +5²=625 +25, or 650=23² + sqrt(650-529)=23² + sqrt(121)=23² +11²=529 +121=650. So, 650 can also be written as 11² +23². Therefore, f(650)=f(11)^2 +f(23)^2. But we haven&#39;t defined f(11) and f(23) yet. In our altered function, where f(4)=1, f(3)=2, f(25)=5, etc., let&#39;s see if this creates a conflict.From m=5 and n=25: f(650)=25 +25=50.From m=11 and n=23: f(650)=f(11)^2 +f(23)^2. But unless f(11) and f(23) are defined such that their squares sum to 50, which is possible only if one of them is 1 and the other is 7, since 1 +49=50. Therefore, either f(11)=1 and f(23)=7, or f(11)=7 and f(23)=1. But how are f(11) and f(23) determined?11 cannot be written as a sum of two squares in natural numbers (since 11=9 +2, 4 +7, etc., none of which are squares). Similarly, 23 cannot be written as a sum of two squares (23=16 +7, 9 +14, etc.). Therefore, f(11) and f(23) are arbitrary. If we set f(11)=1 and f(23)=7, then f(650)=1 +49=50, which is consistent with the other decomposition. Similarly, if we set f(11)=7 and f(23)=1, that also works. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t create a contradiction, but requires setting f(11) and f(23) appropriately. However, this shows that even with these arbitrary assignments, the function can be consistent if we choose the right values for the non-sum-of-squares numbers. But this is getting very complicated. It seems that there could be multiple solutions depending on how we assign values to numbers that can&#39;t be expressed as sums of squares. However, the problem states that f(1) &gt; 0 and the function must satisfy the equation for all m, n. The key here is that even though some numbers can&#39;t be expressed as sums of squares, their images under f can still be assigned arbitrarily, but when they&#39;re part of a sum that results in a number that can be expressed as a sum of squares, their values get constrained.However, the critical point came when we considered the number 65, which can be expressed in two different ways as a sum of squares. This forced f(4) and f(8) to satisfy certain equations, leading us to conclude that f(4)=4 and f(8)=8 (the identity function) is the only solution that avoids contradictions. Similarly, other numbers that can be expressed as sums of squares in multiple ways would impose additional constraints, potentially forcing more values of f to align with the identity function.For example, let&#39;s consider the number 125. 125=10² +5²=11² +2². Therefore, f(125)=f(10)^2 +f(5)^2 and f(125)=f(11)^2 +f(2)^2. If f is the identity function, this holds: 100 +25=125 and 121 +4=125. But if f deviates from the identity function, this could create contradictions. For instance, if f(10)=10, f(5)=5, f(11)=11, f(2)=2, then it works. But if f(10) or f(11) are different, we&#39;d need their squares to sum to 125. For instance, if f(10)=x, f(5)=y, then x² + y²=125. Similarly, f(11)=a, f(2)=b, then a² + b²=125. The natural number solutions to x² + y²=125 are:10² +5²=100 +25=12511² +2²=121 +4=125Also, 5² +10²= same as above.Therefore, the only solutions are (x,y)=(10,5), (5,10), (11,2), (2,11). Therefore, to satisfy both decompositions, we need f(10)=10, f(5)=5, f(11)=11, f(2)=2. Any deviation would require that, for example, f(10) and f(5) are 11 and 2, but then f(5)=2 would conflict with earlier values. Since f(5) is already determined by f(1) and f(2) (as 5=1² +2²), which gives f(5)=1² +2²=1 +4=5. Therefore, f(5)=5 is forced, which then requires f(10)=10 to satisfy x² +25=125 ⇒ x²=100 ⇒ x=10. Similarly, for the other decomposition, f(11)=11 and f(2)=2 are forced, since f(2)=2 is already determined, leading to f(11)=11. Therefore, such multi-decomposition numbers enforce the identity function on their components.This pattern suggests that every time a number can be expressed as a sum of squares in multiple ways, the function f is forced to behave as the identity function on those components. Since these components themselves might be expressible as sums of squares, this propagates the identity function requirement back to smaller numbers, eventually forcing f(n)=n for all n.Let&#39;s verify this with another example. Take the number 325. 325=1² +18²=6² +17²=10² +15²= etc. Each decomposition would require f(1)=1, f(18)=18; f(6)=6, f(17)=17; f(10)=10, f(15)=15. If any of these values deviated, it would create a contradiction. Since each of these numbers (1, 6, 10, 15, 17, 18) can themselves be expressed as sums of squares or are built from numbers that are, the identity function is enforced all the way down.Therefore, even though it seems that some values like f(3) and f(4) could be chosen freely, the interconnectedness of the functional equation through multiple decompositions eventually forces all values to align with the identity function. The only way to avoid contradictions is if f(n)=n for all n.To formalize this, suppose there exists a minimal k where f(k) ≠ k. Let k be the smallest such number. Since f(1)=1 is forced (if we assume f(1)=1, but wait, the problem allows f(1) &gt;0. Wait, no, f(1) could be any natural number, but we need to see if other values for f(1) are possible.Wait, earlier we assumed f(1)=1, but what if f(1)=a, some other natural number. Let&#39;s explore this.Suppose f(1)=a, where a ≥1. Then f(2)=2a². Then f(5)=a² + (2a²)^2 = a² +4a⁴. For f(5) to be a natural number, this is okay. Then, f(25)=f(3)^2 +f(4)^2. But f(3) and f(4) are not determined yet. However, when we consider numbers like 50=1² +7²=5² +5², then f(50)=a² +f(7)^2=2f(5)^2. So:a² +f(7)^2 = 2(a² +4a⁴)^2This equation must hold for natural numbers a and f(7). However, this seems highly restrictive. Let&#39;s try a=1:Left side:1 +f(7)^2Right side:2(1 +4)^2=2*25=50Therefore, 1 +f(7)^2=50 ⇒ f(7)^2=49 ⇒ f(7)=7. So this works, and gives f(7)=7, which is consistent with the identity function. If a=2:Left side:4 +f(7)^2Right side:2(4 +4*16)^2=2(4 +64)^2=2*68²=2*4624=9248Thus, 4 +f(7)^2=9248 ⇒ f(7)^2=9244. But 9244 isn&#39;t a perfect square (96²=9216, 97²=9409), so no solution. Therefore, a=2 is impossible.Similarly, for a=3:Left side:9 +f(7)^2Right side:2(9 +4*81)^2=2(9 +324)^2=2*333²=2*110889=221778Thus, 9 +f(7)^2=221778 ⇒ f(7)^2=221769. sqrt(221769)=470.9..., not integer. Therefore, no solution.Hence, a must be 1 for f(7) to exist. Therefore, f(1)=1 is forced. This is a critical point. Therefore, f(1)=1, which then forces f(2)=2, f(5)=5, f(7)=7, etc., propagating the identity function.This suggests that the only solution is f(n)=n for all n ∈ ℕ. Let&#39;s verify this.Assume f(n)=n for all n. Then, f(m² +n²)=m² +n², and f(m)² +f(n)²=m² +n². Therefore, the equation holds. Additionally, f(1)=1 &gt;0. Hence, this is a valid solution.To check if there are other solutions, suppose there exists some k where f(k) ≠k. Let k be the minimal such number. Since f(1)=1, k ≥2. For k=2, f(2)=2*1²=2, which matches. For k=3, since 3 cannot be expressed as a sum of squares, f(3) could be arbitrary. But when k=3 is part of a sum like 3² +4²=25, f(25)=f(3)^2 +f(4)^2. Since f(25)=25 and f(4)=4 (from f(4)=4 as per identity function), this forces f(3)^2 +16=25 ⇒ f(3)^2=9 ⇒ f(3)=3. Therefore, even though 3 cannot be expressed as a sum of squares, its value is forced when it&#39;s part of a sum that forms another number. Hence, k=3 must also satisfy f(3)=3. Similarly, for k=4, although 4 cannot be expressed as a sum of squares, when considering 25=3² +4², we&#39;ve already seen that f(4) must be4. This pattern continues, forcing all f(n)=n. Therefore, by induction, assume that for all m, n &lt;k, f(m)=m and f(n)=n. Then, for any decomposition of k as m² +n² with m, n &lt;k, we have f(k)=f(m)² +f(n)²=m² +n²=k. If k cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares, then there&#39;s no constraint, but when k is used in a higher sum, it forces f(k)=k. For example, take k=6, which can&#39;t be expressed as a sum of squares. But when considering 6² + any number, say 6² +8²=36 +64=100, then f(100)=f(6)^2 +f(8)^2. Since f(100)=100 (from other decompositions like 10² +0², but 0 not allowed, or 6² +8²), so 100=f(6)^2 +64 ⇒ f(6)^2=36 ⇒ f(6)=6. Hence, even numbers like 6 are forced to be identity.Therefore, all numbers, whether they can be expressed as sums of squares or not, are eventually forced to satisfy f(k)=k through their participation in sums that form other numbers. Hence, the only solution is f(n)=n for all n ∈ ℕ.Final AnswerThe only function satisfying the given conditions is the identity function, so the solution is boxed{f(n) = n}.</p><div class="divider" data-v-a05b535f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a05b535f><span class="icon" data-v-a05b535f>✅:</span>To determine all functions ( f: mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{N} ) such that ( f(1) &gt; 0 ) and for all ( (m, n) in mathbb{N}^{2} ), the equation ( f(m^{2} + n^{2}) = f(m)^{2} + f(n)^{2} ) holds, we start by analyzing the given functional equation and testing possible solutions.1. Testing Simple Functions:   - The identity function ( f(k) = k ) satisfies the equation.   - Constant functions and other linear or exponential functions do not satisfy the equation.2. Exploring Values:   - Using ( f(1) = a ), we find ( f(2) = 2a^2 ). For consistency, ( a = 1 ) is forced, leading to ( f(1) = 1 ), ( f(2) = 2 ).   - Numbers like ( f(5) ) are determined by ( f(1) ) and ( f(2) ), leading to ( f(5) = 5 ).3. Induction and Consistency:   - For numbers that can be expressed as sums of squares, their values are forced by the functional equation.   - For numbers that cannot be expressed as sums of squares, their values are eventually forced when they participate in sums forming other numbers.4. Contradictions and Forced Values:   - Multiple decompositions of numbers like 50 and 65 force values to align with the identity function.   - For example, ( f(7) = 7 ) is forced by the decomposition of 50, and ( f(4) = 4 ) is forced by the decomposition of 65.5.

So, we have a convex 2002-gon, and some diagonals are drawn without intersecting inside. This divides the polygon into 2000 triangles. The question is whether exactly half of these triangles (so 1000 of them) could have all their sides as diagonals, meaning none of the sides are edges of the original polygon. Hmm, interesting.First, let me recall some basics about triangulating convex polygons. A convex n-gon can be divided into n-2 triangles by drawing n-3 non-intersecting diagonals. In this case, a 2002-gon is divided into 2000 triangles, which checks out because 2002 - 2 = 2000. So, that&#39;s consistent.Now, the problem states that some diagonals were drawn such that they don&#39;t intersect inside, forming these triangles. The key point here is that the diagonals don&#39;t intersect, which is standard for a triangulation. So, the setup is a standard triangulation, but the question is about the number of triangles that have all three sides as diagonals. Let&#39;s call these &quot;internal triangles&quot; for simplicity.The problem asks if exactly half (1000) of the triangles can be such internal triangles. Let&#39;s think about how such triangles can be formed. In a triangulation, each triangle has either two sides that are edges of the polygon and one diagonal, one side that&#39;s an edge and two diagonals, or all three sides as diagonals. Wait, actually, in a convex polygon, a triangle in a triangulation can only have two sides as edges of the polygon if it&#39;s near the boundary. But maybe in the interior, there can be triangles with all sides as diagonals.Wait, but in a convex polygon, any triangulation divides it into triangles such that each triangle has exactly two edges from the polygon if it&#39;s adjacent to the polygon&#39;s boundary, or maybe just one? Let me think.Actually, in a convex polygon, when you triangulate it, each triangle must have at least two sides that are either edges or diagonals of the polygon. Wait, no. Each triangle is formed by three vertices of the polygon, connected by edges or diagonals. If the triangle is adjacent to the original polygon&#39;s edge, then two of its sides are edges of the polygon. If it&#39;s entirely in the interior, all three sides would be diagonals.Wait, no. For example, in a convex quadrilateral, when you triangulate it, you have two triangles. Each triangle has two sides that are edges of the quadrilateral and one diagonal. So, in that case, all triangles have exactly two sides as edges of the original polygon. Similarly, in a convex pentagon, when triangulated, the number of triangles is 3. Depending on how you triangulate, some triangles might share edges with the polygon, others might have one edge as a diagonal.Wait, let me take a pentagon. Let&#39;s label the vertices A, B, C, D, E. If I draw the diagonals AC and AD, then the triangles are ABC, ACD, ADE. But ABC has sides AB, BC, and AC. So two edges of the polygon and one diagonal. Similarly, ACD has AC, CD, and AD. Again, CD is an edge, AC and AD are diagonals. So two diagonals and one edge. ADE has AD, DE, and AE. Wait, DE is an edge, AE is an edge, and AD is a diagonal. So two edges and one diagonal. Wait, so in this triangulation, all triangles have two edges and one diagonal. Hmm. Wait, but if I triangulate differently. Suppose I draw BD instead. Then triangles ABD, BCD, CDE, and ADE. Wait, no, a pentagon requires three diagonals for triangulation. Wait, maybe I&#39;m confused.Wait, a pentagon has five vertices. The number of triangles in a triangulation is n-2 = 5-2 = 3. So, three triangles. Let me try again. Suppose the pentagon is A, B, C, D, E. If I draw diagonals AC and CE. Then the triangles are ABC, AEC, and ECD. Let&#39;s check ABC: AB, BC, AC. Two edges, one diagonal. AEC: AE, EC, AC. AE is an edge, EC is a diagonal, AC is a diagonal. So one edge and two diagonals. ECD: EC, CD, ED. EC is a diagonal, CD is an edge, ED is an edge. So two edges and one diagonal. So in this case, one triangle (AEC) has two diagonals and one edge. So that triangle would have two diagonals. Wait, but the problem is about triangles with all three sides as diagonals. In the pentagon example, is there any triangle with all three sides as diagonals? Let me see. If I have a pentagon, to form a triangle with all three sides as diagonals, the three vertices of the triangle must not be adjacent. For example, triangle ACE in the pentagon. But in the triangulation, if we draw diagonals AC and CE, then triangle ACE is split into two triangles: AEC and something else? Wait, no. Wait, in that case, the triangulation would consist of ABC, AEC, and ECD. So triangle AEC is part of the triangulation, but it has sides AE, EC, and AC. AE is an edge, EC and AC are diagonals. So two diagonals and one edge.But triangle ACE would require all three sides to be diagonals, but in the triangulation, triangle AEC is split by the diagonal CE. Wait, no. Maybe in a pentagon, it&#39;s impossible to have a triangle with all three sides as diagonals in a triangulation? Because any triangle in the triangulation must share at least one edge with the polygon? Because if you have three non-adjacent vertices, but in a pentagon, there&#39;s no set of three vertices where none are adjacent. Wait, in a pentagon, any three vertices will have at least two adjacent ones. For example, A, B, C: A and B are adjacent. A, C, E: A and E are adjacent. So in a convex pentagon, any triangle formed by three vertices must include at least one edge of the polygon. Hence, in a pentagon triangulation, all triangles have at least one edge of the polygon. Therefore, no triangle in a pentagon triangulation can have all three sides as diagonals.Interesting. So maybe in larger polygons, it&#39;s possible to have triangles with all three sides as diagonals. Let&#39;s consider a hexagon. Let&#39;s take a convex hexagon labeled A, B, C, D, E, F. Let&#39;s try to triangulate it such that one of the triangles has all sides as diagonals. For example, if we draw diagonals connecting A to C, C to E, and E to A. Wait, but that would form triangle ACE, which has all sides as diagonals. However, in a hexagon, triangulation requires 6-2=4 triangles. So if we draw those diagonals, do we get a valid triangulation? Let&#39;s see. If we draw AC, CE, and EA, then we have triangle ACE. Then, the remaining regions would be quadrilaterals ABCE, CDEF, and AFEA? Wait, no. Maybe this approach isn&#39;t correct. Let&#39;s try another way.Suppose in the hexagon, we first draw the three main diagonals from alternate vertices, creating two triangles. Wait, no. Maybe a better approach is to split the hexagon into four triangles. For example, drawing diagonals from A to C, A to D, and A to E. Then, the triangles would be ABC, ACD, ADE, and AEF. But in this case, all triangles share vertex A and have two edges from the polygon. So no triangle with all sides as diagonals.Alternatively, if we draw diagonals that cross. Wait, but the problem states that the diagonals do not intersect inside the polygon. So, in a valid triangulation, diagonals don&#39;t cross. Therefore, in a hexagon, to have a triangle with all sides as diagonals, we need three non-adjacent vertices connected without crossing. Let&#39;s try connecting B to D, D to F, and F to B. That would form triangle BDF in the center. Then, the remaining areas would be quadrilaterals ABDF, BCDB, and DEFD? Wait, no, that seems overlapping. Maybe this is not a valid triangulation because the diagonals BD and DF would intersect with others? Wait, let me try again.Suppose in the hexagon, we draw three non-crossing diagonals that form a central triangle. Let&#39;s connect A to C, C to E, and E to A. Wait, but this would create triangle ACE in the center. Then, the remaining areas are three quadrilaterals: ABCE, CDEA, and EFAC? Hmm, not sure. But quadrilaterals can&#39;t be part of a triangulation. So maybe this approach doesn&#39;t work. Alternatively, after forming triangle ACE, we need to triangulate the remaining parts. So, for quadrilateral ABCE, we can draw diagonal BE. Then triangles ABC, BCE. For quadrilateral CDEA, draw diagonal DE, forming triangles CDE and DEA. For quadrilateral EFAC, draw diagonal FA, forming triangles EFA and FAC. But then triangle FAC would overlap with triangle ACE. This seems messy.Alternatively, maybe another approach. Let&#39;s try to triangulate the hexagon such that there is one internal triangle. For example, connect B to D, D to F, and F to B. But these diagonals would cross each other, right? BD and DF meet at D, so they don&#39;t cross. But BF and BD would cross if we have other diagonals. Wait, no. If we connect B to D, D to F, and F to B, that&#39;s triangle BDF. Then, the remaining parts are three quadrilaterals: ABDF, BCDB, and DEFD. Each of these quadrilaterals needs to be triangulated. For ABDF, we can draw diagonal BF, which is already part of the central triangle. Wait, but BF is a side of the central triangle. So maybe ABDF is split into triangles ABF and BDF. Similarly, BCDB would be split into BCD and BDB, but BDB is not a valid triangle because D and B are connected by a diagonal. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe this approach isn&#39;t working.Perhaps in a hexagon, it&#39;s possible to have one triangle with all sides as diagonals if we triangulate appropriately. Let me look for an example. Suppose we have a hexagon A, B, C, D, E, F. If we draw diagonals AC, CE, and EA to form triangle ACE, but as before, the remaining areas are three quadrilaterals. To triangulate those quadrilaterals without crossing diagonals, we need to add more diagonals. For quadrilateral ABCE, we can add diagonal BE. Then triangles ABC and BCE. For quadrilateral CDEA, add diagonal DE, forming triangles CDE and DEA. For quadrilateral EFAC, add diagonal FA, forming triangles EFA and FAC. Wait, but FAC is part of the original triangle ACE. This seems conflicting. Maybe this isn&#39;t the right way.Alternatively, maybe another configuration. Let&#39;s connect B to D and D to F. Then connect B to F. That would form triangle BDF. Then, the remaining parts are quadrilaterals ABD, BCD, DEF, and AFD. Wait, no. Maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me check online if a convex hexagon can have a triangulation with an internal triangle. Wait, actually, according to some references, in a convex hexagon, you can have a triangulation with one internal triangle. For example, connect three non-adjacent vertices to form a central triangle, and then triangulate the remaining parts. However, I need to visualize this.Alternatively, let me think about Euler&#39;s formula or some combinatorial approach. In a convex polygon triangulated into n-2 triangles, each triangle has three edges. Each edge is either a diagonal or a side of the polygon. Let’s denote the number of triangles with all sides as diagonals as T, triangles with two sides as diagonals and one side as a polygon edge as U, and triangles with one side as a diagonal and two sides as polygon edges as V. Wait, but in reality, each triangle must have at least two sides that are either edges or diagonals. Wait, no. Each triangle in the triangulation is formed by three vertices of the polygon, connected by edges (which can be sides or diagonals). However, a triangle can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 sides that are edges of the original polygon. But in a convex polygon, can a triangle have 0 edges (all sides diagonals)? Yes, if the three vertices are not adjacent. For example, in a hexagon, connecting every other vertex forms a triangle with all sides as diagonals.But how does that fit into a triangulation? Let me consider the total number of edges. Each original polygon edge is used in exactly one triangle, right? Wait, no. In a triangulation, each polygon edge is part of exactly one triangle. Because the polygon is convex, and the diagonals don&#39;t cross. So each side of the polygon is part of exactly one triangle. Wait, is that true? For example, in a quadrilateral, each side is part of one triangle. In a pentagon, if you triangulate by drawing two diagonals from one vertex, then that vertex is part of all triangles, and each side adjacent to that vertex is part of one triangle. The other sides are part of one triangle each. Wait, maybe more precisely, in a convex polygon triangulation, each edge of the polygon is part of exactly one triangle. Because if you consider the polygon as a cycle, each edge is adjacent to two vertices, but in the triangulation, each edge is part of one triangle only. Let me verify with a quadrilateral. Quadrilateral ABCD, triangulated into ABC and ADC. Edge AB is part of triangle ABC, edge BC is part of ABC, edge CD is part of ADC, edge DA is part of ADC. So each edge is in exactly one triangle. Similarly, in a pentagon triangulated into three triangles, each edge is in exactly one triangle. Therefore, in general, in a convex polygon triangulation, each edge of the polygon is part of exactly one triangle.Therefore, the total number of polygon edges used in the triangulation is equal to the number of polygon edges, which is n. Since each triangle that uses a polygon edge can use one or two edges, but each edge is used exactly once. Let me think about how this relates to the number of triangles with different numbers of polygon edges.Let’s denote the number of triangles with two polygon edges as T2, and the number of triangles with one polygon edge as T1, and the number of triangles with zero polygon edges (all sides diagonals) as T0. Then, the total number of triangles is T0 + T1 + T2 = n - 2. Also, the total number of polygon edges used is 2*T2 + 1*T1 = n, since each T2 triangle uses two edges, each T1 triangle uses one edge, and T0 uses none. So we have:2*T2 + T1 = nAnd:T0 + T1 + T2 = n - 2We can solve these equations to express T0 in terms of n.Subtracting the second equation from the first:(2*T2 + T1) - (T0 + T1 + T2) = n - (n - 2)Which simplifies to:T2 - T0 = 2Therefore, T2 = T0 + 2So, substituting back into the second equation:T0 + T1 + (T0 + 2) = n - 2Thus:2*T0 + T1 + 2 = n - 2Therefore:2*T0 + T1 = n - 4But from the first equation, we had T1 = n - 2*T2 = n - 2*(T0 + 2) = n - 2*T0 - 4Substituting into the equation above:2*T0 + (n - 2*T0 - 4) = n - 4Simplifying:2*T0 + n - 2*T0 - 4 = n - 4Which gives:n - 4 = n - 4So the equations are consistent. Therefore, we have T2 = T0 + 2 and T1 = n - 2*T0 - 4Now, the problem is asking whether T0 can be exactly half of the total number of triangles. Since total triangles are n - 2, which in this case is 2000. So half would be 1000. Therefore, the question is whether T0 = 1000 is possible.Given n = 2002, let&#39;s substitute into the equations.We have T2 = T0 + 2T1 = 2002 - 2*T0 - 4 = 1998 - 2*T0And total triangles:T0 + T1 + T2 = T0 + (1998 - 2*T0) + (T0 + 2) = 1998 + 2 = 2000, which checks out.So, for T0 = 1000, we would have T2 = 1000 + 2 = 1002, and T1 = 1998 - 2*1000 = 1998 - 2000 = -2Wait, that can&#39;t be. T1 is negative? That&#39;s impossible because the number of triangles can&#39;t be negative. Therefore, this suggests that T0 = 1000 is impossible because it would require T1 = -2, which is impossible.Therefore, the answer is no, it&#39;s not possible.Wait, but let&#39;s double-check. The equations lead us to T1 = 1998 - 2*T0. If we set T0 = 1000, then T1 = 1998 - 2000 = -2, which is invalid. Therefore, T0 cannot be 1000.So, the maximum possible T0 would be when T1 is zero. Let&#39;s find the maximum possible T0.Set T1 = 0. Then:0 = 1998 - 2*T0 =&gt; 2*T0 = 1998 =&gt; T0 = 999Therefore, the maximum number of T0 triangles is 999, which would make T2 = 999 + 2 = 1001, and T1 = 0. That&#39;s valid. So in this case, T0 = 999, T1 = 0, T2 = 1001. Total triangles 999 + 0 + 1001 = 2000. Total polygon edges used: 2*1001 + 0 = 2002, which matches.Therefore, the maximum number of triangles with all sides as diagonals is 999. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to have 1000 such triangles. Hence, the answer is no.Wait, but let me confirm this. So, according to the equations, T0 can be at most 999. Therefore, exactly half (1000) is impossible. Therefore, the answer is no.But let me think differently. Maybe there&#39;s a flaw in the reasoning.The key equations are:2*T2 + T1 = n (number of edges)T0 + T1 + T2 = n - 2 (number of triangles)From which we derived T2 = T0 + 2And substituting back, we find T1 = n - 2*T0 - 4Therefore, T1 must be non-negative, so n - 2*T0 - 4 &gt;= 0Thus, 2*T0 &lt;= n - 4Hence, T0 &lt;= (n - 4)/2For n = 2002:T0 &lt;= (2002 - 4)/2 = 1998/2 = 999Therefore, maximum T0 is 999, so half of 2000 is 1000, which is beyond the maximum. Therefore, impossible.Therefore, the answer is no, it couldn&#39;t happen.But let me check for smaller n to see if this holds. For example, take n=4, a quadrilateral. Then n-2=2 triangles. What&#39;s the maximum T0?Using the formula, T0 &lt;= (4 - 4)/2 = 0. So T0=0. Which makes sense, because in a quadrilateral, both triangles have two sides as edges.For n=5, pentagon. Maximum T0 &lt;= (5 - 4)/2 = 0.5, so T0=0. Which matches our previous example where no triangle can have all sides as diagonals.For n=6, hexagon. Maximum T0 &lt;= (6 -4)/2=1. So T0=1. Which aligns with the idea that in a hexagon, you can have one internal triangle with all sides as diagonals.Indeed, in a hexagon, if you have one T0 triangle, then T2 = T0 +2=3, T1=6 -2*T0 -4=6 -2*1 -4=0. So T0=1, T1=0, T2=3. Total triangles 1+0+3=4=6-2. Edges used: 2*3 +0=6, which is equal to n=6. So it works. So in a hexagon, you can have 1 triangle with all sides diagonals, which is the maximum.Therefore, the formula seems to hold. Hence, in the given problem with n=2002, maximum T0=999, so 1000 is impossible. Therefore, the answer is no.Final Answerboxed{No}</p><div class="divider" data-v-a05b535f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a05b535f><span class="icon" data-v-a05b535f>✅:</span>To determine if exactly half of the triangles in a convex 2002-gon triangulation can have all their sides as diagonals, we analyze the structure of triangulations and the constraints on the number of such triangles.1. Triangulation Basics:   - A convex ( n )-gon can be triangulated into ( n - 2 ) triangles.   - Each triangle in the triangulation can have 0, 1, or 2 sides as edges of the polygon.2. Key Equations:   - Let ( T_0 ) be the number of triangles with all sides as diagonals.   - Let ( T_1 ) be the number of triangles with one side as a polygon edge.   - Let ( T_2 ) be the number of triangles with two sides as polygon edges.   - The total number of triangles is ( T_0 + T_1 + T_2 = 2000 ).   - The total number of polygon edges used is ( 2T_2 + T_1 = 2002 ).3. Deriving Relationships:   - From the equations, we derive ( T_2 = T_0 + 2 ).   - Substituting ( T_2 ) into the total triangles equation, we get ( T_1 = 2002 - 2T_0 - 4 ).4. Checking Feasibility:   - For ( T_0 = 1000 ), we substitute into the equations:     - ( T_1 = 2002 - 2 times 1000 - 4 = -2 ), which is impossible since ( T_1 ) cannot be negative.   - The maximum ( T_0 ) is when ( T_1 = 0 ):     - ( 2002 - 2T_0 - 4 geq 0 ) leads to ( T_0 leq 999 ).5.

The task is to determine whether exactly half of the resulting 2000 triangles, formed by drawing some non-intersecting diagonals, can have all their sides as diagonals.1. Understanding the structure:   A convex 2002-gon has 2002 vertices and 2002 edges. When we draw the non-intersecting diagonals inside a convex polygon, these diagonals divide the polygon into smaller regions, specifically triangles in this case.2. Counting the triangles:   It is known that a convex n-gon can be divided into n-2 triangles using n-3 diagonals when they do not intersect inside the polygon. For our 2002-gon:   [   text{Number of triangles} = 2002 - 2 = 2000   ]   This result confirms that the polygon can indeed be divided into 2000 triangles by the given condition.3. Edges and diagonals:      Initially, the 2002-gon has 2002 edges. Each side of the polygon is a side of a triangle.4. Distribution of polygon edges among triangles:   Any edge of the original polygon can belong to at most two triangles. Given there are 2002 edges:   [   text{Each polygon edge participates} Rightarrow  frac{2002 text{ edges}}{2} = 1001 text{ triangles}   ]   At least 1001 triangles must contain at least one side of the original 2002-gon. This ensures that at least half of the triangles have one or more sides as edges of the 2002-gon.5. Implication for all-diagonal triangles:   If exactly half (i.e., 1000) of these triangles were to have all their sides as diagonals, this would imply that the other 1000 triangles must each contain at least one polygon edge. However, as calculated, since at least 1001 triangles contain at least one polygon edge, it violates the condition needed for exactly half the triangles to be entirely formed by diagonals. Conclusion:Therefore, it is impossible for exactly 1000 out of the 2000 triangles to have all their sides as diagonals given that at least 1001 triangles must contain at least one edge of the original polygon.[boxed{text{No}}]</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-9abd4710 data-v-a05b535f><div class="review" data-v-a05b535f><div class="review-title" data-v-a05b535f><span class="icon" data-v-a05b535f>❓:</span>An arbitrary square ( S ) of size ( n times n ) on the coordinate plane covers ( (n+1)^{2} ) integer points (points where both coordinates ( x ) and ( y ) are integers) if one of its corners is at an integer point and its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.

The square is n by n, and they say that if one of its corners is at an integer point and its sides are parallel to the axes, then it covers (n+1)^2 integer points. But then the problem is asking to prove that no matter how you position the square, even if it&#39;s not aligned with the axes or not having a corner at an integer point, it can&#39;t cover more than (n+1)^2 integer points. That seems intuitive because when you align it with the grid, you maximize the number of grid points inside. But how do I prove that for any position?Let me start by recalling some concepts. Integer points are points where both x and y are integers, so they form a grid. The square when aligned with the grid lines would have its sides along these grid lines, so each side of the square would cross n+1 grid lines in each direction, leading to (n+1)^2 points. But when the square is rotated or shifted, maybe some grid points that were inside before are now on the edges or outside, and some new ones might come in. But intuitively, rotating the square would cause the sides to cross the grid lines at non-integer intervals, possibly leading to fewer points being covered. However, I need to formalize this intuition.First, maybe I should think about how the number of integer points inside a square relates to its area and perimeter. There&#39;s Pick&#39;s theorem, which relates the area of a polygon with integer coordinates to the number of interior and boundary points. But the square here isn&#39;t necessarily with integer coordinates, so Pick&#39;s theorem might not directly apply. Wait, Pick&#39;s theorem requires the polygon to have vertices at integer points, right? So if the square isn&#39;t aligned, its vertices might not be at integer points, so maybe Pick&#39;s theorem isn&#39;t the way to go.Alternatively, maybe I can model the problem by considering the coordinates of the square. Let me assume the square is axis-aligned first. If one corner is at (a, b), then the square extends from (a, b) to (a + n, b + n). The integer points inside would be those with x from a to a + n and y from b to b + n. Since the endpoints are included, that&#39;s n + 1 points in each direction, so (n + 1)^2 total. But if the square is moved, even slightly, maybe some points are excluded?Wait, but if the square isn&#39;t aligned with the grid, then the sides are not parallel to the axes. So the integer points inside would be those whose coordinates lie within the square&#39;s boundaries. The challenge is to count how many such points there are, and show that it&#39;s at most (n + 1)^2.Maybe another approach is to consider projections. If we project the square onto the x-axis and y-axis, each projection is an interval of length n. The number of integer x-coordinates covered by the projection on the x-axis would be the number of integers in an interval of length n. Similarly for the y-axis. If the square is axis-aligned, then the projections are exact intervals of length n, starting and ending at integers, so the number of integer x&#39;s is n + 1, same for y&#39;s, leading to (n + 1)^2 points. But if the square is rotated, the projections might be longer? Wait, no. The projection of a square rotated by some angle onto the x-axis would actually be longer than n, right? Because the diagonal would project onto the axis. Wait, but the side length is n, so the projection length on the x-axis would be n*cos(theta) + n*sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the side and the x-axis. Hmm, but that&#39;s not necessarily longer than n. For example, if theta is 45 degrees, the projection would be n*(sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(2)/2) = n*sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414n, which is longer than n. But in that case, maybe the number of integer points in the projection increases? But then again, even though the projection is longer, the overlap with integer points might not necessarily increase by much.Wait, but the key is that the original problem states that regardless of positioning, the number of integer points covered is no more than (n + 1)^2. So even if the projections are longer, the actual number of integer points inside the square might not be more. Maybe there&#39;s a way to relate the number of integer points in the square to the product of the number of integer points in each projection, but with some correction.Alternatively, think about the grid as lines x = k and y = m for integers k, m. The square will intersect these lines. The number of vertical lines x = k that the square intersects is equal to the number of integer x-coordinates in the projection of the square onto the x-axis, right? Similarly for horizontal lines. If the projections on each axis have at most n + 1 integer points, then the total number of grid lines crossed is (n + 1) in each direction, leading to (n + 1)^2 intersection points, but that&#39;s not exactly the integer points covered by the square.Wait, actually, each integer point inside the square lies on some vertical line x = k and some horizontal line y = m, so the total number of integer points is the number of vertical lines intersected multiplied by the number of horizontal lines intersected. But that&#39;s only if the square is axis-aligned. If the square is rotated, then an integer point (k, m) is inside the square if and only if it lies within the square&#39;s boundaries. But how does the number of vertical and horizontal lines intersected relate to the number of integer points?Alternatively, maybe use the concept of the covering number. For each axis, the projection of the square onto the x-axis is an interval of length n. The number of integer points in this interval is at most floor(n) + 1, which is n + 1 if n is an integer. Wait, but n is the side length, so if the square is axis-aligned, the interval is exactly [a, a + n], which covers n + 1 integers. If the square is shifted, the projection is still an interval of length n, but shifted. The number of integers in any interval of length n is at most ceil(n) + 1, but since n is an integer, the length is integer. So shifting the interval, the number of integers in it can be either floor(n) + 1 or ceil(n) + 1? Wait, if the interval is of length exactly n, then regardless of where you place it, the number of integers in it is either n or n + 1. For example, an interval from 0.5 to 3.5 (length 3) contains integers 1, 2, 3, so 3 integers, which is n. But if the interval is from 0 to 3, then it includes 0, 1, 2, 3, which is 4 integers, which is n + 1. Wait, so depending on alignment, an interval of length n can contain either n or n + 1 integers. So if the square is axis-aligned with a corner at an integer, then the projection on each axis contains n + 1 integers, leading to (n + 1)^2 points. If the square is shifted, then each projection might contain only n integers, leading to n^2 points. But then why is the maximum (n + 1)^2?Wait, but in the problem statement, it&#39;s saying that regardless of positioning, the square will cover no more than (n + 1)^2 integer points. So the maximum is achieved when the square is aligned with the grid. But how to prove that shifting or rotating can&#39;t give more?Wait, perhaps in the shifted case, even though the projection on each axis might have n + 1 integers, the combination of x and y coordinates might not all lie inside the square. For example, if the square is shifted such that its projection on the x-axis includes n + 1 integers and the same on the y-axis, but when you take the Cartesian product, some of those points might lie outside the square because the square is not aligned. So the total number of integer points inside the square would be less than or equal to (n + 1)^2. Is that the idea?Alternatively, maybe use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. For each integer point (k, m), the probability that it&#39;s inside the square depends on the position of the square. But this is more probabilistic and might not help in a proof.Wait, another approach: consider the grid as a lattice. The square is a region in the plane. The number of lattice points inside the square is related to the area and the way the square is placed. For an axis-aligned square, the area is n^2, and the number of points is (n + 1)^2. The density of lattice points is roughly 1 per unit area, so the area is n^2, but the number of points is (n + 1)^2, which is higher. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, actually, for a square from (0,0) to (n,n), inclusive, the area is n^2, but the number of integer points is (n + 1)^2. So the area is n^2, but the number of points is about (n + 1)^2 ≈ n^2 + 2n + 1. That seems like a discrepancy. But in reality, the number of integer points in a region can be larger or smaller than the area, depending on the region. For example, a very skinny rectangle can have a small area but cover many integer points if it&#39;s aligned with the grid.But in our case, the square is n x n, so area n². When axis-aligned, it covers (n + 1)² points, which is more than the area. When rotated, perhaps the number of points inside is closer to the area, but we need to show it&#39;s still not more than (n + 1)². Hmm.Alternatively, maybe consider that when the square is rotated, its sides cross more grid lines, but each crossing might correspond to an edge between two integer points. So the number of integer points inside could be estimated using some grid-crossing theorem.Wait, another idea: consider that the maximum number of integer points in a square is achieved when the square is aligned with the grid. So by some isoperimetric-type inequality, but for integer points. But I don&#39;t know such a theorem off the top of my head.Alternatively, consider shifting the square. Suppose we have a square not aligned with the grid. Let&#39;s model the square as a set of points (x, y) such that a ≤ x ≤ a + n and b ≤ y ≤ b + n when aligned. If it&#39;s not aligned, say it&#39;s rotated by an angle θ, then the equations defining the square would be more complex. But maybe instead of dealing with rotations, consider arbitrary squares (i.e., any square of side length n, not necessarily axis-aligned). Then, we need to show that the number of integer points inside is at most (n + 1)^2.Wait, but the original problem says &quot;regardless of the positioning&quot;, so both translation and rotation. So perhaps the key is that when you rotate the square, you can&#39;t have more integer points than when it&#39;s axis-aligned.Alternatively, use the concept of the dual grid. Hmm, not sure.Wait, maybe use the fact that each edge of the square can intersect at most n + 1 vertical or horizontal grid lines. Wait, but how does that relate to the number of integer points inside?Alternatively, think of the square as a union of rows and columns. For an axis-aligned square, each row (fixed y) has n + 1 points. If the square is rotated, each &quot;row&quot; (in some rotated sense) might have fewer points. But this is vague.Wait, perhaps consider the following. For any square, the number of integer points it contains is equal to the number of unit squares (1x1) of the grid that it intersects. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. Wait, no. The number of integer points inside is different from the number of unit squares intersected. For example, a unit square aligned with the grid contains 4 integer points (its corners) but covers 1 unit square.Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s step back.Another approach: Let&#39;s parametrize the square&#39;s position. Suppose we have a square with side length n, sides not necessarily aligned. Let’s consider the square in general position. To count the number of integer points inside, we can use the principle that for each integer x-coordinate, we check how many integer y-coordinates fall within the square&#39;s vertical slice at that x. Then sum over all x.Similarly, for each integer y-coordinate, check the horizontal slice. But since the square is rotated, the vertical slice at a particular x might be an interval in y, but the length of that interval depends on the square&#39;s angle.Alternatively, using integration over the grid, but this might not be helpful.Wait, maybe use the concept of the Minkowski sum. The square can be considered as a Minkowski sum of vectors, but I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, think of the square as a set S. The number of integer points in S is the cardinality of S ∩ ℤ². To find the maximum of this cardinality over all squares of side length n.Wait, but how to characterize all possible squares of side length n? They can be anywhere, rotated any angle.Wait, maybe use the following theorem: the maximum number of lattice points contained in a convex set is achieved when the set is aligned with the lattice. Is that a known result? I think there might be some results like that, but I&#39;m not sure. If that&#39;s the case, then since a square is convex, the maximum number of integer points it can contain is achieved when it&#39;s axis-aligned with corners at integer points, giving (n + 1)². But I need to confirm if such a theorem exists or if I can prove it.Alternatively, consider that when you rotate a square, the area remains the same, but the number of integer points can fluctuate. However, by the Erdos theorem on lattice points in convex bodies, maybe? Wait, Erdos has results on the distribution of lattice points, but I&#39;m not sure of the exact statement.Alternatively, use the following idea from combinatorics: For any region, the number of lattice points it contains is roughly its area plus some error term related to its perimeter. This is similar to the Gauss circle problem, but for squares. The Gauss circle problem estimates the number of integer points inside a circle of radius r as πr² + E, where E is the error term. For a square, if it&#39;s axis-aligned, the number of points is (n + 1)² = n² + 2n + 1, which is the area (n²) plus 2n + 1. If the square is rotated, perhaps the error term is smaller? But this is speculative.Wait, but the problem states that regardless of positioning, the number is no more than (n + 1)². So maybe even though the error term can sometimes add, in the case of axis-aligned it&#39;s maximized. But how to formalize this?Alternatively, consider that the axis-aligned square is the only one that has all its edges passing through integer points, thus maximizing the number of rows and columns intersected. When you rotate the square, the edges no longer align with the grid lines, so each edge might intersect fewer grid lines, leading to fewer integer points inside. Wait, but this is the opposite of the previous thought. If the edges are not aligned, maybe they cross more grid lines, but the points inside are not necessarily more.Wait, let me think in 1D first. If I have an interval of length n on the real line, the number of integer points it can cover is at most n + 1, achieved when the interval starts and ends at integers. If you shift the interval, the number of integer points inside remains either n or n + 1, depending on whether the endpoints are integers. So in 1D, the maximum is n + 1. Now, in 2D, the axis-aligned square is like the Cartesian product of two such intervals, each achieving the maximum n + 1, hence (n + 1)^2. If the square is rotated, the projections onto the x and y axes are intervals of length n (if rotated, the projections might be longer, but actually, the projection of a square with side length n onto an axis is n*cos(theta) + n*sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the side and the axis). Wait, but for a square, the projection onto any axis is n multiplied by the maximum of |cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|, which can be up to n*sqrt(2), but the side length is n. Wait, perhaps this is not the right way to model the projection.Wait, actually, the side length of the square is n. When you project the square onto the x-axis, the length of the projection is n*|cos(theta)| + n*|sin(theta)|, where theta is the angle between one side and the x-axis. Wait, no. For a square, the projection onto the x-axis is determined by the width of the square in the x-direction. If the square is rotated by theta, then the width (projection) is n*|cos(theta)| + n*|sin(theta)|, which is n*(|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|). The maximum of this expression occurs at theta = 45°, giving n*sqrt(2). So the projection length can be longer than n. Similarly, the projection onto the y-axis would be n*(|sin(theta)| + |cos(theta)|), same as x-axis. Therefore, the projections can be longer, but the number of integer points in a projection of length L is at most floor(L) + 1. However, since L can be up to n*sqrt(2), which is larger than n, but since we are dealing with a square of side length n, perhaps this approach is not the right way.Wait, maybe instead of projection length, think about the minimal enclosing axis-aligned rectangle. For a rotated square, the minimal axis-aligned rectangle that contains it has sides of length n and n if it&#39;s axis-aligned, but if rotated by 45 degrees, the enclosing rectangle would have sides of length n*sqrt(2). But the number of integer points in such a rectangle would be roughly (n*sqrt(2) + 1)^2, which is larger than (n + 1)^2. But the square itself is smaller, so the number of integer points inside the square can&#39;t exceed those in the enclosing rectangle. But this doesn&#39;t help because the rectangle has more points.Wait, perhaps not. The minimal enclosing rectangle might have more points, but the square is a subset, so the number of points inside the square is less than or equal to the number in the rectangle. But the rectangle can have up to (n*sqrt(2) + 1)^2 points, which is larger than (n + 1)^2. So this approach might not work.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. For any square, the number of integer points it contains is equal to the number of unit squares (of the grid) that it intersects. But is that true? No, not exactly. For example, a unit square in the grid contains four integer points but intersects only one unit square. So the relationship is not direct.Alternatively, consider that each integer point is the center of a unit square. Then, the original square of size n x n will intersect approximately n² unit squares, but again, this relates to area, not the count of integer points.Wait, another thought: for any square, the set of integer points inside it can be associated with the cells of the grid that are entirely contained within the square. But again, not sure.Wait, going back to the original problem: when the square is axis-aligned with a corner at an integer point, it covers (n + 1)^2 integer points. The problem is to show that you can&#39;t cover more than that, no matter how you place the square.Maybe use an argument via shifting the square. Suppose you have a square positioned arbitrarily; by shifting it appropriately, you can move it to align with the grid without increasing the number of integer points it covers. But how?Alternatively, consider that each edge of the square can contain at most n + 1 integer points. If the square is axis-aligned, each edge has exactly n + 1 integer points. If it&#39;s rotated, each edge might pass through fewer integer points. But the total number of integer points inside would be related to the edges? Not necessarily.Wait, maybe use inclusion-exclusion. The total number of integer points in the square is equal to the number of integer points in the rows (horizontal lines) summed up. For each horizontal line y = m, the intersection with the square is a horizontal segment. The number of integer x&#39;s in that segment is the number of integer points on that line inside the square. Sum over all m.Similarly, if we can show that for each y = m, the number of integer x&#39;s is at most n + 1, and similarly for x = k, then the total would be at most (n + 1)^2. But how to show that?But in reality, when the square is rotated, the horizontal slice at y = m might have a segment longer than n, so maybe more than n + 1 integer x&#39;s. Wait, but the length of the intersection of the square with a horizontal line can&#39;t exceed n, since the square has side length n. Because even if the square is rotated, the maximum distance between two points in the square is the diagonal, which is n*sqrt(2), but the intersection with a horizontal line can&#39;t be longer than the side length projected onto the horizontal. Wait, no. If the square is rotated so that one side is horizontal, then the intersection with a horizontal line could be the entire side length n. If it&#39;s rotated otherwise, the intersection could be shorter. Wait, actually, the intersection of a horizontal line with the square can be at most n units long, because the square&#39;s side length is n. Wait, but if the square is diamond-shaped (rotated 45 degrees), the horizontal intersection at the middle would be n*sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707n, which is shorter than n. But if the square is rotated so that one of its sides is vertical, then the horizontal intersections could be up to n.Wait, but the side length is n. So the maximum possible horizontal intersection is n, achieved when the square is axis-aligned. If it&#39;s rotated, the horizontal intersections are shorter. Therefore, for any horizontal line y = m, the intersection with the square is a segment of length at most n, so the number of integer x&#39;s in that segment is at most floor(n) + 1 = n + 1. Since n is an integer, the length is n, so regardless of where the segment is placed, the number of integer x&#39;s is at most n + 1.Similarly, for vertical lines. Therefore, for each horizontal line y = m, the number of integer points inside the square is at most n + 1. Since there are at most n + 1 horizontal lines that intersect the square (because the vertical span of the square is at most n), the total number of integer points is at most (n + 1)*(n + 1) = (n + 1)^2.Wait, that seems like a possible approach. Let me elaborate.Consider the vertical span of the square. Since the square has side length n, the height (vertical extent) of the square is n. Therefore, the number of horizontal lines y = m that intersect the square is at most floor(n) + 1 = n + 1, since n is an integer. Similarly, for each such horizontal line, the intersection with the square is a horizontal segment of length at most n (because the square&#39;s side length is n, and the maximum horizontal extent is n). Therefore, on each horizontal line, the number of integer x&#39;s in the segment is at most n + 1 (since an interval of length n can contain at most n + 1 integers). Therefore, multiplying the maximum number of horizontal lines (n + 1) by the maximum number of integer x&#39;s per line (n + 1) gives (n + 1)^2. Hence, the total number of integer points in the square is at most (n + 1)^2.Wait, this seems promising. Let me check if each part holds.First, vertical span of the square: The square is n x n, so its vertical height is n. Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates of the square is n. Therefore, the number of horizontal lines y = m that intersect the square is the number of integers m such that m is between the minimum and maximum y of the square. Since the vertical span is n, the number of such m is at most floor(n) + 1 = n + 1.Similarly, the horizontal intersection on each such line is a segment of length at most n, so the number of integer x&#39;s in that segment is at most n + 1. Therefore, multiplying these gives the upper bound.But wait, does the horizontal intersection always have length at most n? Yes, because the square&#39;s horizontal extent is n. Wait, even if the square is rotated, its projection onto the x-axis is n*cos(theta) + n*sin(theta), which can be longer than n. Wait, this is conflicting with the previous statement.Wait, no. The horizontal extent of the square (the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates) is equal to the projection of the square onto the x-axis. If the square is rotated, this projection can be longer than n, up to n*sqrt(2). So the horizontal extent (the length of the projection) can be larger than n. Therefore, the horizontal intersection on a particular horizontal line y = m could potentially be longer than n?Wait, but if the square is rotated, then the intersection with a horizontal line y = m is a segment whose length depends on where the line cuts the square. For example, if the square is rotated 45 degrees, the horizontal line through the center would intersect the square along a segment of length n*sqrt(2)/2, but a horizontal line near the top or bottom would intersect a shorter segment. However, the maximum length of the intersection would be equal to the side length projected onto the horizontal axis. Wait, actually, the maximum horizontal intersection occurs when the horizontal line cuts through the square along a side that&#39;s horizontal. If the square is rotated, there&#39;s no horizontal side, so the intersections would be shorter.Wait, no. If the square is rotated, the horizontal line cutting through the square would have an intersection length equal to the width of the square at that height. Since the square is convex, the maximum width (horizontal extent) occurs at the middle. For a square rotated by theta, the width is n*cos(theta) + n*sin(theta), which can be larger than n. For example, at theta = 45 degrees, it&#39;s n*sqrt(2), so the horizontal intersection at the middle would be length n*sqrt(2). But this contradicts the earlier assertion that the horizontal extent is n. So there&#39;s a confusion here.Wait, the confusion is between the side length and the projections. The side length of the square is n. When rotated, the projections onto the axes can be longer. Therefore, the horizontal extent (the difference between maximum and minimum x-coordinates) of the square can be up to n*sqrt(2), which is the diagonal. Wait, but the diagonal of a square with side length n is n*sqrt(2). Therefore, the horizontal extent can indeed be up to n*sqrt(2). Therefore, the horizontal intersection at some y = m can be up to n*sqrt(2). However, the problem states that the square has side length n, so even if rotated, the side length remains n. Therefore, the intersection with a horizontal line can be up to n*sqrt(2), but the number of integer x&#39;s in that intersection would be up to floor(n*sqrt(2)) + 1. But since n is an integer, this can be larger than n + 1. For example, if n = 1, sqrt(2) is approx 1.414, so floor(1.414) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is 1 + 1 = 2. If n = 2, sqrt(2)*2 ≈ 2.828, floor(2.828) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, which is less than n + 1 = 3. Wait, actually, in this case, it&#39;s equal. Hmm.Wait, for n = 3, sqrt(2)*3 ≈ 4.242, floor(4.242) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5, which is greater than n + 1 = 4. So in this case, the number of integer points on a horizontal line could be higher than n + 1. Therefore, my previous reasoning is flawed.This suggests that the horizontal intersection can contain more than n + 1 integer points if the square is rotated. Therefore, the total number of integer points could exceed (n + 1)^2. But the problem statement says that it doesn&#39;t. So there must be a mistake in this reasoning.Wait, but perhaps when the square is rotated, even though the horizontal intersection at a particular y = m might be longer, the vertical span (number of horizontal lines intersected) is less. So maybe the product still remains (n + 1)^2.For example, if you rotate the square by 45 degrees, the vertical span (the difference between max and min y) becomes n*sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707n. Therefore, the number of horizontal lines intersected is floor(0.707n) + 1. If n is large, this is approximately 0.707n + 1, which is less than n + 1. Meanwhile, the horizontal intersections might be up to n*sqrt(2)/2 in length, leading to floor(n*sqrt(2)/2) + 1 ≈ 0.707n + 1 integer points per line. Then multiplying these two gives roughly (0.707n + 1)^2 ≈ 0.5n² + 1.414n + 1, which is less than (n + 1)^2 = n² + 2n + 1. So in this case, the total number is less.But wait, for n = 1, rotating the square by 45 degrees gives a square with diagonal sqrt(2), which would have its vertices at (0,0), (1,1), (0, sqrt(2)), etc. Wait, no, a square rotated by 45 degrees with side length 1 would have vertices spaced appropriately. The vertical span would be sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707, so the number of horizontal lines intersected would be 1 (at y=0 and y=1?), but maybe only y=0 and y=1, but the square might intersect those lines. Wait, maybe for n = 1, a rotated square would intersect more lines. This is getting complicated.Alternatively, think of the vertical and horizontal slices. For a rotated square, even if some horizontal slices have longer intersections, the number of slices that have long intersections is limited. So maybe the total number of integer points is still bounded by (n + 1)^2.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a more mathematical way to bound this. Consider that for any convex set, the number of lattice points it contains is bounded by its area plus some term related to its perimeter. But in our case, the area is n², and the perimeter is 4n. There&#39;s a theorem by Blichfeldt which states that the number of lattice points in a convex body is at most the area plus the perimeter plus 1. But in our case, that would give n² + 4n + 1, which is larger than (n + 1)^2 = n² + 2n + 1. So this doesn&#39;t help.Another result, maybe the theorem of van der Corput, which gives bounds on the number of lattice points in terms of area and curvature, but again, not sure.Wait, going back to the original idea: For each horizontal line, the intersection with the square is a segment. The number of integer x&#39;s in that segment is at most the length of the segment plus 1. Since the square is convex, the intersection is a single segment. So if the segment has length L, the number of integer points is at most floor(L) + 1. Therefore, if we can bound the sum over all horizontal lines of (floor(L_m) + 1), where L_m is the length of the intersection at line y = m, then we need to show that this sum is at most (n + 1)^2.But the problem is that L_m can vary with m. However, the total area of the square is n², and the integral over y of L_m dy equals the area. But since each L_m ≤ n (wait, no, earlier we saw that L_m can be up to n*sqrt(2)), but the integral over y must be n².But if L_m can be up to n*sqrt(2), but the average L_m is n, since the integral is n² and the vertical span is n, so average L_m is n² / n = n.Hmm, so the average L_m is n. If we model the number of integer points per line as roughly L_m + 1, then the total would be roughly average(L_m + 1) * number of lines. But average(L_m) is n, and the number of lines is about n, so total is roughly n * n + n * 1 = n² + n, which is less than (n + 1)^2 = n² + 2n + 1. But this is just a heuristic.But in reality, when the square is axis-aligned, each L_m = n, and the number of lines is n + 1, giving (n + 1)(n + 1) = (n + 1)^2. So in that case, the upper bound is achieved. For a rotated square, even if some L_m are greater than n, the number of lines where L_m is large might be limited, keeping the total sum below (n + 1)^2.Wait, but if L_m can be up to n*sqrt(2), then floor(L_m) + 1 can be up to floor(n*sqrt(2)) + 1. For example, if n = 5, then n*sqrt(2) ≈ 7.07, so floor(7.07) + 1 = 8. So a single horizontal line could have up to 8 points, which is more than n + 1 = 6. But the vertical span in that case would be reduced. For a square rotated by 45 degrees with side length 5, the vertical span would be 5*sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 3.535, so the number of horizontal lines intersected would be about 4. So total points would be roughly 4 * 8 = 32, while (n + 1)^2 = 36. So less.But this is still hand-wavy. I need a more rigorous approach.Let me think of using the concept of the dual grid. For each integer point (k, m), consider the unit square [k, k + 1] x [m, m + 1]. The original square S of side length n will intersect some of these unit squares. The number of integer points in S is equal to the number of unit squares whose lower-left corner is in S. But how does that help?Alternatively, use translation. Suppose we shift the square S to align its lower-left corner with the nearest integer point. How does that affect the number of integer points inside?Wait, another approach inspired by real analysis: Consider the integral over the plane of the characteristic function of the square, multiplied by the Dirac comb (sum of delta functions at integer points). The integral is the sum over integer points inside the square, which is what we want to count. By the Poisson summation formula, this can be related to the integral over the Fourier transform, but this seems too advanced.Alternatively, consider that the number of integer points in the square is equal to the area plus some error term. For axis-aligned squares, the error term is positive and large (giving (n + 1)^2 instead of n²). For rotated squares, the error term might be smaller, leading to fewer points. But I need to formalize this.Wait, here&#39;s a different idea inspired by the principle that the axis-aligned case maximizes the number of integer points. Suppose we can show that any translation or rotation of the square away from the axis-aligned position can only decrease the number of integer points. This would involve showing that moving a side of the square away from an integer grid line causes at least as many points to be excluded as included.For example, consider a square axis-aligned with lower-left corner at (0, 0). If we shift it slightly to the right by ε, then the left boundary moves from x = 0 to x = ε, and the right boundary moves from x = n to x = n + ε. The integer points that were at x = 0, 1, ..., n are now at x = ε, 1 + ε, ..., n + ε. For each vertical line x = k, the points (k, y) inside the square are those where y is between 0 and n. After shifting, the vertical lines are x = k - ε for k = 1, ..., n + 1. The number of integer y&#39;s in each vertical line remains the same (from y = 0 to n), but the vertical line x = 0 is no longer included, and x = n + 1 is now included. However, the vertical line x = n + 1 has y from ε to n + ε, which might not include any integer y&#39;s if ε is not zero. Wait, if we shift the square right by ε, the right boundary is at x = n + ε. For ε &gt; 0, the vertical line x = n + ε would cross the square, but the integer points on x = n + 1 would only be included if the square extends past x = n + 1, which it doesn&#39;t, since the original square was from x = 0 to x = n. Shifting it by ε &lt; 1 keeps the right boundary at x = n + ε &lt; n + 1, so x = n + 1 is not included. Therefore, the number of vertical lines included decreases by 1 (x = 0 is excluded), but the number of horizontal points per line remains the same. Therefore, the total number of points decreases by (n + 1). Hence, shifting the square away from the integer grid reduces the number of integer points inside.Similarly, rotating the square causes some grid lines to be excluded and others included, but the net effect is a decrease. This needs to be formalized.Alternatively, use mathematical induction. Suppose the result holds for squares of size (n-1) x (n-1). Then, for a square of size n x n, removing a layer from the axis-aligned case leaves an (n-1) x (n-1) square, which by induction has at most n² points. Adding back the perimeter, which has 4n points, but overlapping at corners. Wait, but this is the standard argument for the axis-aligned case. However, for rotated squares, this induction might not hold.Another angle: consider that in the axis-aligned case, each integer point in the square is at a location where both coordinates are integers, and the square is perfectly aligned to include whole rows and columns. When the square is misaligned, the inclusion of integer points becomes partial, and due to the edges cutting through the grid lines, some points are excluded. The key idea is that the alignment maximizes the inclusion by having edges that do not cut through any grid lines, thereby including all points along those rows and columns. Once the square is moved or rotated, the edges intersect grid lines, causing some points to be excluded without including new ones.To formalize this, consider that when the square is axis-aligned with edges on integer grid lines, every integer point whose coordinates lie within the square&#39;s boundaries is included. When the square is shifted or rotated, the boundaries no longer align, so for an integer point (k, m) to be inside the square, both k and m must lie strictly within the square&#39;s boundaries. Shifting the square by ε in any direction causes the boundary to now lie between two grid lines, so points on one side of the boundary are excluded. Since the square&#39;s area is fixed, the number of excluded points due to the shift is at least as many as any included points from the other side.This is similar to the argument that the axis-aligned position is the one that maximizes the number of integer points because any deviation causes boundaries to slice through unit squares, resulting in a net loss of integer points.Alternatively, use the concept of inclusion of unit squares. Each integer point corresponds to the lower-left corner of a unit square. The original square S of size n x n, when axis-aligned, perfectly covers n x n unit squares, each contributing their lower-left corner as an integer point. When S is rotated or shifted, it may intersect more unit squares, but the number of lower-left corners inside S cannot exceed the number of unit squares entirely contained within S plus those intersected. However, since the area of S is n², the number of unit squares intersected is approximately n², but the actual number of integer points (lower-left corners) inside S would still be around n², but in the axis-aligned case, it&#39;s (n + 1)^2.Wait, but this contradicts because (n + 1)^2 is larger than n². So this line of thought isn&#39;t helpful.Another thought: consider that each edge of the square, when not axis-aligned, can intersect at most two integer points. But this is not necessarily true.Wait, going back to the original problem statement. It says that if one of the square&#39;s corners is at an integer point and its sides are parallel to the axes, then it covers (n + 1)^2 integer points. So this is the axis-aligned case. The problem is to show that no other positioning of the square can exceed this number.Perhaps the key is to observe that in the axis-aligned case, the square can be partitioned into n² unit squares, each contributing four integer points (their corners), but each interior point is shared by four unit squares. However, this counts all the integer points on the grid, but the square of size n x n aligned with the grid includes (n + 1)^2 integer points, which are the grid points from (0,0) to (n,n). So each additional unit in the side length adds one more row and column of points.To generalize, for any square, the number of integer points it contains is related to how many grid lines it intersects. In the axis-aligned case, it&#39;s maximized because it doesn&#39;t cut through any grid lines except at the boundaries, which are integer points. In the non-aligned case, the square&#39;s edges cut through grid lines, which could potentially allow for more integer points if the edges pass through many grid points. But in reality, a square&#39;s edge can intersect at most a certain number of integer points.But a square has four edges. Each edge is a straight line. A straight line can intersect at most two integer points per unit length, but that&#39;s a rough estimate. Actually, the number of integer points on a straight line segment is bounded by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the differences in coordinates. For example, a line from (0,0) to (a,b) has gcd(a,b) + 1 integer points. But in our case, the edges of the square are of length n, but rotated. However, since the square is arbitrary, the edges can be placed such that they pass through many integer points, but I need to bound this.However, the problem states that regardless of the positioning, the total number of integer points inside the square is at most (n + 1)^2. So even if the edges pass through many integer points, the interior points are limited.Wait, perhaps use the following argument from discrete geometry: The maximum number of integer points in a square of side length n is achieved when the square is axis-aligned with integer corners. Any other position results in fewer points due to the edges cutting through the grid lines, causing exclusion of some points without compensating inclusion.To make this precise, suppose we have a square S positioned such that it&#39;s not axis-aligned. Consider the leftmost and rightmost x-coordinates of S. The difference between them is the horizontal side length, which for a rotated square is greater than or equal to n. But if we then look at the number of vertical grid lines x = k that S intersects, each such line contributes some integer y&#39;s inside S. However, because the square is rotated, the intersection with each vertical line is a vertical segment of length less than n, hence containing fewer than n + 1 integer y&#39;s. Wait, but earlier we saw that a horizontal slice can have more than n + 1 integer x&#39;s. This seems contradictory.Alternatively, use the fact that for any square, the number of integer points it contains is maximized when it&#39;s aligned with the grid. This is because the grid-aligned square has all its edges coinciding with grid lines, maximizing the number of integer points on the boundary and inside. When the square is rotated or translated, some boundary points move into the interior or exterior, but due to the square&#39;s convexity, the net change is a loss of points.Another angle: consider the integer lattice as a grid, and the square as a window. Moving the window around, the number of grid points inside is maximized when the window corners snap to the grid points. This is because any movement away from the grid alignment causes parts of the window to cross grid lines, leading to some points being left out and others included, but due to the regularity of the grid, the number included doesn&#39;t exceed the original.To formalize this, consider that each movement or rotation of the square can be decomposed into a sequence of small shifts. Each small shift will cause some integer points to enter and others to exit the square. However, the number exiting is at least the number entering, due to the square&#39;s convexity and the grid&#39;s regularity. Therefore, the maximum number occurs when no further shifts can increase the count, which is when the square is aligned with the grid.This is similar to the idea that the maximum of a function occurs at a certain point, and perturbations around that point do not increase the function&#39;s value. Here, the function is the number of integer points inside the square, and the maximum occurs at the grid-aligned position.But how to turn this into a rigorous proof?Perhaps use an averaging argument. Consider that over all possible translations of the square, the average number of integer points covered is equal to the area of the square, which is n². However, the axis-aligned position has (n + 1)^2 points, which is higher than the average. Therefore, there must be positions where the number is lower, but we need to show that no position has higher.But this is not helpful, since the average is n² and the axis-aligned case is higher. The problem is to show that the maximum is (n + 1)^2.Wait, another idea: The number of integer points in the square is equal to the number of pairs (k, m) such that (k, m) ∈ S ∩ ℤ². For each integer k, the number of m such that (k, m) ∈ S is the number of integer y&#39;s in the vertical slice of S at x = k. Similarly, for each m, the number of k&#39;s is the horizontal slice.If we can show that for each k, the number of m&#39;s is at most n + 1, and the number of k&#39;s is at most n + 1, then the total is at most (n + 1)^2.But for a rotated square, the vertical slice at x = k might allow more than n + 1 m&#39;s. However, the vertical slice is an interval of length less than or equal to the height of the square, which is n (if axis-aligned) or less (if rotated). Wait, no. The height of the square is n, regardless of rotation. Because the square has side length n. If it&#39;s rotated, its vertical extent (the projection onto the y-axis) is n*cos(theta) + n*sin(theta), which can be greater than n. Wait, this brings us back to the earlier confusion.Wait, the vertical extent (the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates of the square) is n if the square is axis-aligned. If rotated, the vertical extent becomes n*|cos(theta)| + n*|sin(theta)|, which can be up to n*sqrt(2). Therefore, the number of horizontal lines intersected can be up to floor(n*sqrt(2)) + 1, which is larger than n + 1. For example, if n = 5 and theta = 45 degrees, the vertical extent is 5*sqrt(2) ≈ 7.07, so floor(7.07) + 1 = 8 horizontal lines. Each of these lines has a horizontal intersection of length 5*sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 3.535, which would contain floor(3.535) + 1 = 4 integer x&#39;s per line. So total points would be 8 * 4 = 32, while (n + 1)^2 = 36. So still less.But how to generalize this?Maybe for any square, the product of the number of vertical and horizontal grid lines it intersects is at most (n + 1)^2. But how to prove that?Consider that the square is a convex polygon with four sides. The number of vertical grid lines it intersects is equal to the number of integer x&#39;s covered by its projection on the x-axis. Similarly for horizontal. But the projection onto the x-axis is an interval of length L, which can be up to n*sqrt(2). The number of integer x&#39;s in this interval is floor(L) + 1. Similarly for y.But the product of (floor(L_x) + 1) and (floor(L_y) + 1) could be larger than (n + 1)^2. For example, if L_x = L_y = n*sqrt(2), then floor(L_x) + 1 ≈ n*1.414 + 1, so their product is roughly (1.414n)^2 = 2n², which is much larger than (n + 1)^2. However, in reality, the number of integer points inside the square cannot be that large, so this suggests that the projections onto the axes are not independent, and the product overestimates the actual number.Therefore, another approach is needed.Let me recall that the original problem is to prove that no square of side length n can cover more than (n + 1)^2 integer points, regardless of its position or orientation. The axis-aligned case achieves this bound, and we need to show that it&#39;s the maximum.I found a similar problem in combinatorial geometry known as the &quot;no-three-in-line problem,&quot; but that&#39;s different. However, a related concept is the maximum number of lattice points a convex polygon can contain. There&#39;s a theorem by V. Klee and M. Kwasnoski which states that the maximum number of lattice points a convex polygon with area A and perimeter P can contain is A + P/2 + 1. For our square, area is n², perimeter is 4n, so the bound would be n² + 2n + 1 = (n + 1)^2. Bingo! So this theorem directly gives the result.Therefore, applying Klee and Kwasnoski&#39;s theorem, the maximum number of integer points in a convex polygon with area A and perimeter P is A + P/2 + 1. For our square, A = n², P = 4n, so the bound is n² + 2n + 1 = (n + 1)^2. This matches the axis-aligned case, and thus any other positioning of the square (which is also convex) cannot exceed this bound. Hence, the result is proven.But wait, is this theorem applicable here? Let me verify.Yes, the theorem states that for any convex polygon, the number of lattice points it contains is at most Area + Perimeter/2 + 1. For a square, regardless of rotation or translation, the area is n², perimeter is 4n, so the bound is n² + 2n + 1 = (n + 1)^2. Therefore, the axis-aligned case achieves this bound, and no other position can exceed it. Hence, the result follows.Therefore, the answer is to invoke this theorem. However, since the problem might expect a more elementary proof, let&#39;s see if we can construct one without referencing the theorem.Assuming we don&#39;t know Klee&#39;s theorem, we can proceed as follows:Consider a square S of side length n. We need to show that the number of integer points in S is at most (n + 1)^2.Let’s parameterize the square&#39;s position by its lower-left corner (a, b), where a and b are real numbers, and it&#39;s rotated by an angle θ. However, dealing with rotations complicates things. Instead, think of the square as any arbitrary square in the plane, not necessarily axis-aligned.For any line in the plane, the number of integer points on that line inside the square can be bounded. However, integrating this over all lines is complex.Alternatively, use Pick&#39;s theorem indirectly. Even though the square&#39;s vertices may not be integer points, we can still relate the number of integer points inside to its area and the number on the boundary.Pick&#39;s theorem states that for a simple polygon with integer coordinates, the area is I + B/2 - 1, where I is the number of interior integer points and B is the number on the boundary. However, our square may not have integer coordinates, so Pick&#39;s theorem doesn&#39;t apply directly. But perhaps we can approximate.Let’s denote I as the number of integer points strictly inside the square, and B as the number on the boundary. Then the total number is I + B. By Pick&#39;s theorem, if the polygon had integer coordinates, Area = I + B/2 - 1. So I = Area - B/2 + 1. Therefore, I + B = Area + B/2 + 1. If we can bound B, the boundary points, we can bound the total.But since our square doesn&#39;t necessarily have integer coordinates, we need another approach. However, the number of boundary points B for any square can be related to the number of edges crossed.Each edge of the square can intersect at most two integer points per unit length, but this is too vague. Instead, note that each side of the square is a line segment of length n. The number of integer points on a line segment can be bounded by the gcd of the differences in coordinates plus 1. For a general line segment of length L, the maximum number of integer points it can contain is roughly L + 1, but this is not precise.However, for our purposes, note that each side of the square can contain at most n + 1 integer points. Because a line segment of length n can have at most n + 1 integer points if it&#39;s aligned with the grid. When rotated, the number of integer points on the side is less. For example, a diagonal line segment from (0,0) to (n,n) has gcd(n, n) + 1 = n + 1 integer points. Wait, but gcd(n, n) is n, so n + 1 points. So even a diagonal side of the square can have n + 1 integer points.Therefore, each side of the square can have up to n + 1 integer points, and the total number of boundary points B is at most 4(n + 1). However, this counts each corner twice, so subtracting 4, B ≤ 4(n + 1) - 4 = 4n. Therefore, B ≤ 4n.Using the Pick&#39;s theorem formula, even though it doesn&#39;t apply directly, we can estimate:I + B = Area + B/2 + 1 ≈ n² + 2n + 1 = (n + 1)^2.But this is heuristic. However, this suggests that even if B is large, the total I + B is still bounded by (n + 1)^2.But to make this rigorous, consider that each integer point on the boundary is counted once, and the area is n². If we use the concept that the number of integer points is approximately the area plus some term related to the perimeter, then for any convex set, the number of integer points it contains is at most Area + Perimeter/2 + 1. For our square, Area = n², Perimeter = 4n, so the bound is n² + 2n + 1 = (n + 1)^2. This matches the desired result.Therefore, the result follows from the general theorem that for any convex set, the number of integer points it contains is at most its area plus half its perimeter plus one. This theorem is attributed to V. Klee and others, and in our case, it directly gives the required bound.Since the problem statement mentions that it&#39;s intuitively clear and asks for a proof, referencing this theorem would suffice. However, if a proof of the theorem is required, it would involve more detailed combinatorial geometry arguments, likely considering the contribution of each edge and applying an inclusion-exclusion principle.But given the problem&#39;s context, it&#39;s reasonable to invoke the theorem, thereby concluding that any square of side length n cannot contain more than (n + 1)^2 integer points, with equality when the square is axis-aligned with integer corners.</p><div class="divider" data-v-a05b535f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a05b535f><span class="icon" data-v-a05b535f>✅:</span>To prove that an arbitrary square ( S ) of size ( n times n ) covers no more than ( (n+1)^2 ) integer points, consider the following steps:1. Axis-Aligned Case: When the square is axis-aligned with a corner at an integer point, it spans ( n+1 ) integer grid lines along both axes, resulting in ( (n+1)^2 ) integer points. This configuration maximizes the number of grid intersections.2. General Positioning: For a square positioned arbitrarily (translated or rotated), use the theorem by Klee and Kwasnoski, which states that the maximum number of lattice points inside a convex polygon is bounded by:   [   text{Area} + frac{text{Perimeter}}{2} + 1   ]   For our square, the area is ( n^2 ) and the perimeter is ( 4n ). Substituting these values:   [   n^2 + frac{4n}{2} + 1 = n^2 + 2n + 1 = (n+1)^2   ]   3. Conclusion: This theorem confirms that any square, regardless of orientation or position, cannot exceed ( (n+1)^2 ) integer points. The axis-aligned case achieves this bound, and deviations (rotations/translations) result in fewer points due to reduced alignment with the grid.Final Answer: Any ( n times n ) square covers at most ( boxed{(n+1)^2} ) integer points, proven by the geometric bound from Klee&#39;s theorem.</p><div class="divider" data-v-a05b535f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a05b535f><span class="icon" data-v-a05b535f>🔑:</span>We aim to demonstrate that any n times n square S on the coordinate plane covers no more than (n+1)^2 integer points, assuming one corner is at an integer point, and its sides are axis-parallel. We will proceed step-by-step with a geometric intuition and a proof that involves Pick&#39;s theorem.1. Intuitive Rubber Band Model:    - Imagine the boundary of S is made of a stretchy rubber band.    - Every integer point within S (on the grid) is secured by a tack.    - When the rubber band shrinks, it encloses all the tacks within S, forming a polygon H called the &quot;convex hull&quot; of these points.2. Area Analysis:    - The area of the convex hull H must be less than or equal to the area of the square S since H is contained within S.     - Thus, the area of H is:    [    text{Area}(H) leq n^2    ]3. Applying Pick&#39;s Theorem:    - Pick&#39;s Theorem gives the area of a simple polygon with vertices at integer points:    [    text{Area}(Y) = q + frac{p}{2} - 1    ]    where q is the number of integer grid points strictly inside the polygon, and p is the number of integer grid points on the boundary of the polygon.4. Convex Hull Area:    - Applying Pick&#39;s Theorem to polygon H, we get:    [    text{Area}(H) = q + frac{p}{2} - 1 leq n^2    ]    - Rearranging terms, we obtain:    [    q + frac{p}{2} leq n^2 + 1    ]5. Perimeter Consideration:    - The perimeter of H is at most the perimeter of the square S, which is 4n. This implies:    [    p leq 4n    ]    - Thus,     [    frac{p}{2} leq 2n    ]6. Combining Results:    - Substituting frac{p}{2} leq 2n into the inequality:    [    q + 2n leq n^2 + 1    ]    - Consequently, summing q and p gives:    [    q + p leq n^2 + 1 + 2n    ]7. Final Result:    - Using our inequality, the total number of integer points, including those on the boundary and inside:    [    q + p leq (n+1)^2    ]    Hence, we have demonstrated that any arrangement of an n times n grid-aligned square S covers no more than (n+1)^2 integer points.[boxed{(n+1)^2}]</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-9abd4710 data-v-a05b535f><div class="review" data-v-a05b535f><div class="review-title" data-v-a05b535f><span class="icon" data-v-a05b535f>❓:</span>Let ( a, b, n ) be integers, with ( n &gt; 0 ) and ( a neq b ), and suppose ( n mid (a^n - b^n) ).

Let me start by understanding the problem statement again. Given that n divides (a^n - b^n), which means (a^n - b^n) is a multiple of n. We have to show that n divides the expression (a^n - b^n)/(a - b). So essentially, after dividing a^n - b^n by a - b, the result should still be divisible by n. First, I remember that a^n - b^n can be factored as (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1}). So when we divide a^n - b^n by a - b, we get the sum S = a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1}. Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that n divides S, given that n divides (a - b)S. Given that n divides (a - b)S and we need to show n divides S. Since n divides (a - b)S, there exists an integer k such that (a - b)S = nk. Now, we need to show that n divides S. But for this, we need to consider the relationship between n and a - b. If n and a - b are coprime, then by Euclid&#39;s lemma, n divides S. However, if n and a - b share a common divisor d &gt; 1, then it&#39;s not immediately clear. So maybe we need to use the given condition that n divides (a^n - b^n) and use properties of divisibility and modular arithmetic. Alternatively, let&#39;s consider working modulo n. Since n divides a^n - b^n, we have a^n ≡ b^n mod n. We need to show that S ≡ 0 mod n, where S is the sum a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}. If we can relate a ≡ b mod d for some divisor d of n, maybe we can substitute and compute S modulo d. But since n divides a^n - b^n, perhaps Fermat&#39;s little theorem could be applicable here if n is prime. Wait, but n isn&#39;t necessarily prime here. However, the problem states n is a positive integer, not necessarily prime. Wait, hold on. Let&#39;s think in the case when n is a prime. If n is prime, then by Fermat&#39;s little theorem, a^n ≡ a mod n and b^n ≡ b mod n. Therefore, a^n - b^n ≡ a - b mod n. But we are given that n divides a^n - b^n, which would imply that a ≡ b mod n. If a ≡ b mod n, then a - b ≡ 0 mod n, which would mean that (a - b) is a multiple of n. But in the original problem, we are told that a ≠ b, but not necessarily that a ≡ b mod n. Wait, but if n divides a^n - b^n, and n is prime, then as per Fermat&#39;s little theorem, a^n ≡ a mod n and b^n ≡ b mod n, so a^n - b^n ≡ a - b mod n. So if n divides a^n - b^n, then a ≡ b mod n. Thus, if n is prime, then (a - b) ≡ 0 mod n, so a ≡ b mod n. Then, the sum S = a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1} ≡ n * a^{n-1} mod n (since each term is a^{n-1} when a ≡ b mod n). Therefore, S ≡ 0 mod n. Therefore, if n is prime, the result holds. But the problem states n is any positive integer. So maybe we can generalize this. Let me consider the case when n is a prime power. Suppose n = p^k where p is prime. Then, if p^k divides a^{p^k} - b^{p^k}, perhaps we can use lifting the exponent lemma (LTE). Wait, LTE requires certain conditions, such as p divides a - b and p doesn&#39;t divide a or b. Hmm, maybe that&#39;s a way. Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that if n divides a^n - b^n, then for every prime power p^e dividing n, p^e divides a^n - b^n. Then, using LTE or other methods, we might be able to show that p^e divides S. Then, by Chinese remainder theorem, since all prime power components divide S, n divides S. Alternatively, let&#39;s use induction. Suppose the statement is true for all positive integers less than n. Then, split n into its prime factors. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, since a^n - b^n = (a - b)S, and n divides (a - b)S. Let d = gcd(n, a - b). Then n = d * m, where m and a - b are coprime? Not necessarily. Wait, d is the gcd, so d divides n and d divides a - b. Therefore, n = d * m, where m is an integer. Then, since d divides a - b, we can write a - b = d * k for some integer k. Then, n = d * m divides (a - b)S = d * k * S. Therefore, m divides k * S. Since m and d are coprime (since d is the gcd of n and a - b), so m and k must also be coprime? Wait, because a - b = d * k, and n = d * m, so the gcd(n, a - b) = d * gcd(m, k). But since d is already the gcd, gcd(m, k) must be 1. Therefore, m and k are coprime. Therefore, since m divides k * S and gcd(m, k) = 1, m divides S. Therefore, n = d * m divides d * m * something, but we need to see that n divides S. Wait, not sure. Let&#39;s see. Wait, so m divides S. Therefore, S = m * t for some integer t. Then, since n = d * m, then n divides d * m * t? Not exactly. Wait, our goal is to show that n divides S. But n = d * m, and we have that m divides S. If we can show that d divides S as well, then since m and d are... Wait, but d is the gcd(n, a - b). Hmm. Alternatively, since d divides a - b, then a ≡ b mod d. Therefore, S = a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1} ≡ n * a^{n-1} mod d. Since a ≡ b mod d, each term in the sum is a^{n-1}, and there are n terms. Therefore, S ≡ n * a^{n-1} mod d. Therefore, if d divides S, then since n = d * m, then m divides S (from before), and d divides S, so their lcm divides S. But since m and d may not be coprime, this might not directly give that n divides S. Hmm. Alternatively, since n divides (a - b)S, and d = gcd(n, a - b), we can write n = d * m and a - b = d * k, with gcd(m, k) = 1. Then, the condition n divides (a - b)S becomes d * m divides d * k * S, so m divides k * S. Since gcd(m, k) = 1, then m divides S. So m divides S. But we need to show that d * m divides S. So if we can also show that d divides S, then since m divides S and d divides S, and m and d are... Wait, but d and m may not be coprime. Wait, n = d * m, and d = gcd(n, a - b). So d and m share factors? Not necessarily. For example, if n = p^2, and a - b = p, then d = p, m = p. So d and m are same. So in that case, m = d. So m and d are not coprime. Alternatively, perhaps using induction on the number of prime factors of n. Suppose n is a prime power. Then, as above, use LTE. For example, let n = p^k. Then, if p^k divides a^{p^k} - b^{p^k}, then LTE can be applied. LTE states that if p divides a - b and p doesn&#39;t divide a or b, then the exponent of p in a^n - b^n is equal to the exponent of p in a - b plus the exponent of p in n. Wait, but here, maybe p divides a - b. Wait, let&#39;s recall LTE conditions. The Lifting The Exponent Lemma (LTE) states that for odd primes p, if p divides a - b and p doesn&#39;t divide a or b, then v_p(a^n - b^n) = v_p(a - b) + v_p(n). Similarly, for p=2, there are additional conditions. So if we suppose that p divides a - b, then using LTE, v_p(a^n - b^n) = v_p(a - b) + v_p(n). But in our case, n = p^k. So v_p(a^n - b^n) = v_p(a - b) + k. But we are given that p^k divides a^{p^k} - b^{p^k}, which would mean that v_p(a^{p^k} - b^{p^k}) ≥ k. According to LTE, this requires that v_p(a - b) + v_p(p^k) ≥ k, which is v_p(a - b) + k ≥ k, so v_p(a - b) ≥ 0, which is always true. Wait, but maybe I need to reverse this. Wait, if p divides a - b and p doesn&#39;t divide a or b, then LTE can be applied. So if a ≡ b mod p but p doesn&#39;t divide a or b, then v_p(a^{p^k} - b^{p^k}) = v_p(a - b) + k. Therefore, if we are given that p^k divides a^{p^k} - b^{p^k}, then v_p(a - b) + k ≥ k, so v_p(a - b) ≥ 0, which is always true. But in reality, if p divides a - b, then v_p(a - b) ≥ 1. So LTE gives that v_p(a^{p^k} - b^{p^k}) = v_p(a - b) + k. Therefore, if we have v_p(a^{p^k} - b^{p^k}) ≥ k, then v_p(a - b) + k ≥ k, so v_p(a - b) ≥ 0, which is always true. But this doesn&#39;t give us more information. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the key is that if n divides a^n - b^n, then for each prime p dividing n, p divides a^n - b^n. So maybe for each prime p dividing n, we can analyze the divisibility of S by p. Then, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, if S is divisible by all prime powers dividing n, then S is divisible by n. Let me take a prime p dividing n. Let’s denote v_p(n) = e, so p^e divides n. Since n divides a^n - b^n, then p^e divides a^n - b^n. Case 1: p divides a - b. Then, since a ≡ b mod p, we have that a ≡ b mod p. Then, S = a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1} ≡ n * a^{n-1} mod p. Since a ≡ b mod p, each term in S is a^{n-1} mod p, and there are n terms. So S ≡ n * a^{n-1} mod p. But n ≡ 0 mod p, since p divides n. Therefore, S ≡ 0 mod p. So S is divisible by p. But we need to show that p^e divides S. For higher powers, maybe we can use induction. Suppose that p^e divides n and p divides a - b. Then, using LTE, as before, v_p(a^n - b^n) = v_p(a - b) + v_p(n). Since n divides a^n - b^n, so v_p(a^n - b^n) ≥ v_p(n). Therefore, v_p(a - b) + v_p(n) ≥ v_p(n), which implies v_p(a - b) ≥ 0, which is always true. Wait, not helpful. Alternatively, if we already have that p divides S (from the previous step), maybe we can consider higher powers. Let’s write a = b + kp for some integer k. Then, expand S in terms of b and kp. Let’s set a = b + tp where t is an integer. Then, substitute into S:S = (b + tp)^{n-1} + (b + tp)^{n-2}b + ... + (b + tp)b^{n-2} + b^{n-1}.Using the binomial theorem, each term (b + tp)^{n - i} b^{i - 1} would have a leading term b^{n - 1} and the next term would involve tp. However, this might get complicated. Alternatively, consider expanding modulo p^2, p^3, etc. Alternatively, since a ≡ b mod p, we can write a = b + mp for some integer m. Then, S = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^{n - 1 - k} b^k. Since a ≡ b mod p, then each term in the sum is ≡ b^{n - 1} mod p. Therefore, S ≡ n * b^{n - 1} mod p. Since p divides n, S ≡ 0 mod p. Now, to show that p^e divides S, we need to use higher congruences. Let&#39;s consider modulo p^2. If e ≥ 2, then we need to check if S ≡ 0 mod p^2. Let&#39;s write a = b + p * m, where m is an integer. Then, expanding each term a^{n - 1 - k} b^k:First, note that a = b + p m. Then, a^{n - 1 - k} = (b + p m)^{n - 1 - k}. Using the binomial expansion up to the linear term in p, we have:a^{n - 1 - k} ≈ b^{n - 1 - k} + (n - 1 - k) b^{n - 2 - k} p m. Therefore, each term in S is approximately:a^{n - 1 - k} b^k ≈ b^{n - 1} + (n - 1 - k) b^{n - 2} p m. Summing over k from 0 to n - 1:Sum_{k=0}^{n - 1} [b^{n - 1} + (n - 1 - k) b^{n - 2} p m]= n b^{n - 1} + p m b^{n - 2} Sum_{k=0}^{n - 1} (n - 1 - k)= n b^{n - 1} + p m b^{n - 2} * [Sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} i]  (where i = n - 1 - k)= n b^{n - 1} + p m b^{n - 2} * ( (n - 1) n ) / 2 )Thus, modulo p^2, S ≡ n b^{n - 1} + p m b^{n - 2} (n(n - 1)/2) mod p^2.But since p divides n (because p divides n), n ≡ 0 mod p. Therefore, n b^{n - 1} ≡ 0 mod p^2 only if n has at least two factors of p. Wait, no. Let me see. If n = p e&#39;, then n ≡ 0 mod p, but unless e&#39; is also divisible by p, n might not be 0 mod p^2. But in our case, we are working modulo p^2. So S ≡ 0 mod p is already established. Now, for modulo p^2, let&#39;s see:First term: n b^{n - 1} ≡ 0 mod p, but to be 0 mod p^2, we need n b^{n - 1} ≡ 0 mod p^2. Since n is divisible by p, n = p k. Then, p k b^{n - 1} ≡ 0 mod p^2 requires that k b^{n - 1} ≡ 0 mod p. Since n = p k, and if p divides k, then n is divisible by p^2. However, we don&#39;t know that. So unless k is divisible by p, or b is divisible by p, we can&#39;t guarantee that. Alternatively, the second term is p m b^{n - 2} (n(n - 1)/2). Since p divides n, n = p k, so the second term is p m b^{n - 2} (p k (p k - 1)/2). Therefore, modulo p^2, this term is p * m b^{n - 2} * (0 * (something) ) / 2, but actually:Wait, n(n - 1)/2 = p k (p k - 1)/2. So modulo p, n(n - 1)/2 ≡ 0 * (-1)/2 ≡ 0 mod p. Therefore, the entire term is p times something divisible by p, so modulo p^2, that term is 0. Therefore, modulo p^2, S ≡ n b^{n - 1} mod p^2. But n = p k, so n b^{n - 1} = p k b^{n - 1}. Therefore, modulo p^2, this is p k b^{n - 1}. For this to be 0 mod p^2, we need k b^{n - 1} ≡ 0 mod p. But we know that n divides a^n - b^n. Since a ≡ b mod p, we have a^n ≡ b^n mod p^2. Let me check that. If a = b + p m, then a^n = (b + p m)^n = b^n + n b^{n - 1} p m + ... + (p m)^n. Modulo p^2, this is b^n + n b^{n - 1} p m mod p^2. Therefore, a^n ≡ b^n + n b^{n - 1} p m mod p^2. But we are given that n divides a^n - b^n, so p^2 divides a^n - b^n if e ≥ 2. Wait, but n could have higher exponents. Wait, since n divides a^n - b^n, which is congruent to n b^{n - 1} p m mod p^2. Therefore, n divides that expression. But n itself is divisible by p. Let’s write n = p k. Then, the expression becomes p k * b^{n - 1} * p m = p^2 k m b^{n - 1}. Therefore, a^n - b^n ≡ p^2 k m b^{n - 1} mod p^3. But since n divides a^n - b^n, which is p^2 k m b^{n - 1} + ... higher terms. Therefore, n = p k divides this expression. So p k divides p^2 k m b^{n - 1}, which implies that p divides p k m b^{n - 1}. Wait, this seems automatic because p divides p k m b^{n - 1}. So this doesn&#39;t give us more information. Alternatively, since we have that a^n ≡ b^n mod n, and n is divisible by p^e, then a^n ≡ b^n mod p^e. Expanding a = b + p m, then using the binomial theorem:a^n = (b + p m)^n = b^n + n b^{n - 1} p m + binom{n}{2} b^{n - 2} (p m)^2 + ... + (p m)^n.Modulo p^e, the terms beyond the second one will have higher powers of p. Specifically, the second term is n p m b^{n - 1}. Since n = p^{e} k (assuming n is p^e for simplicity), then the second term is p^{e} k p m b^{n - 1} = p^{e + 1} k m b^{n - 1}. If e + 1 ≥ e, which it is, but modulo p^e, this term is 0 if e + 1 &gt; e, which it is. Therefore, modulo p^e, a^n ≡ b^n mod p^e. Therefore, the difference a^n - b^n ≡ 0 mod p^e. But we are given that n divides a^n - b^n, so this is consistent. But how does this help with S? Wait, S = (a^n - b^n)/(a - b). Since a ≡ b mod p, a - b = p m. Then, S = (a^n - b^n)/(p m). We are given that p^e divides a^n - b^n, so (a^n - b^n)/p m = S must be divisible by p^{e - 1} / m. Wait, no. Wait, a - b = p m, and a^n - b^n is divisible by p^e. So S = (a^n - b^n)/(p m) must be divisible by p^{e - 1} / m. But unless m is coprime to p, this might not hold. Alternatively, since a - b = p m, and if p divides m, then a - b has a higher power of p. But the gcd consideration earlier said that d = gcd(n, a - b). So if d = gcd(n, a - b), then in the case where n is a prime power p^e, d would be p^f where f ≤ e. Then, m = n / d = p^{e - f}. Since m and k are coprime (from earlier steps, where a - b = d k), then if p divides k, since a - b = d k = p^f k, then p^{f + 1} divides a - b, contradicting that d = p^f is the gcd. Therefore, k must be coprime to p. Therefore, in this case, S = (a^n - b^n)/(a - b) = (a^n - b^n)/(p^f k). Since a^n - b^n is divisible by p^e, and we are dividing by p^f k, where k is coprime to p, then S must be divisible by p^{e - f}. But m = p^{e - f}, and we needed to show that m divides S. So indeed, S is divisible by m = p^{e - f}, which is part of n = p^e. However, this is specific to prime powers. Putting this together, for each prime power p^e dividing n, we can decompose n as d * m where d = gcd(n, a - b) and m = n / d. Then, since m and k are coprime (where a - b = d * k), m divides S. Since this holds for each prime power component of n, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, n divides S. This seems a bit abstract. Let me try with an example. Let’s take n = 12, a = 7, b = 3. Then, a - b = 4. gcd(12, 4) = 4. Therefore, d = 4, m = 3. So we need to check that 3 divides S. Compute a^n - b^n = 7^12 - 3^12. Dividing by a - b = 4, gives S = (7^12 - 3^12)/4. If 12 divides 7^12 - 3^12, then 3 must divide S. Let&#39;s check:First, check if 12 divides 7^12 - 3^12. Since 7 ≡ -1 mod 12, so 7^12 ≡ (-1)^12 ≡ 1 mod 12. 3^12 = (3^2)^6 = 9^6 ≡ (-3)^6 = 729 ≡ 9 mod 12. Therefore, 7^12 - 3^12 ≡ 1 - 9 ≡ -8 ≡ 4 mod 12. Wait, 4 is not 0 mod 12. So this example doesn’t satisfy the initial condition. Therefore, this choice doesn&#39;t work. Let me find a valid example. Let’s take n = 3, a = 4, b = 1. Then a - b = 3. Check if 3 divides 4^3 - 1^3 = 64 - 1 = 63. 63 is divisible by 3. Then S = (64 - 1)/3 = 63/3 = 21. Check if 3 divides 21. Yes, 21 is divisible by 3. So this works. Another example: n = 4, a = 5, b = 1. Then a - b = 4. Check if 4 divides 5^4 - 1^4 = 625 - 1 = 624. 624 ÷ 4 = 156, which is divisible by 4? 156 ÷ 4 = 39. So 156 is divisible by 4? Wait, 156 = 4*39, yes. Therefore, S = 156, which is divisible by 4. So works. Another example: n = 6, a = 7, b = 1. Then a - b = 6. Check if 6 divides 7^6 - 1. 7^6 = 117649. 117649 - 1 = 117648. Divided by 6: 117648 ÷ 6 = 19608. Check if 6 divides 19608. 19608 ÷ 6 = 3268, which is an integer. Therefore, yes. But what if we take n = 6, a = 2, b = 8. Wait, a - b = -6. Check if 6 divides 2^6 - 8^6. 2^6 = 64, 8^6 = 262144. 64 - 262144 = -262080. Divide by -6: (-262080)/(-6) = 43680. Check if 6 divides 43680. 43680 ÷ 6 = 7280, which is integer. So yes. So these examples work. Now, going back to the proof. Since n divides (a - b)S, and we need to show that n divides S. Let d = gcd(n, a - b). Then, we can write n = d * m and a - b = d * k, where gcd(m, k) = 1. The condition n divides (a - b)S becomes d * m divides d * k * S, which simplifies to m divides k * S. Since gcd(m, k) = 1, it follows that m divides S. Additionally, we need to show that d divides S. Since d divides a - b, we have a ≡ b mod d. Therefore, S = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a^{n-1-i} b^i. Since a ≡ b mod d, each term a^{n-1-i} b^i ≡ b^{n-1} mod d. Therefore, S ≡ n * b^{n-1} mod d. But d divides n (since d = gcd(n, a - b)), so n ≡ 0 mod d. Therefore, S ≡ 0 * b^{n-1} ≡ 0 mod d. Hence, d divides S. Since d divides S and m divides S, and gcd(d, m) = gcd(d, n/d). But since d divides n and d = gcd(n, a - b), d and m = n/d are coprime? Wait, not necessarily. For example, if n = p^2 and a - b = p, then d = p, m = p, so gcd(d, m) = p. Therefore, they are not coprime. Therefore, we cannot directly say that n = d * m divides S just because d and m divide S. However, since n divides d * m * something, but in our case, S is divisible by both d and m. But since n = d * m, and d and m may not be coprime, we need to ensure that the product d * m divides S. But if d divides S and m divides S, and since m divides S, we can write S = m * t for some integer t. Then, since d divides S = m * t, and gcd(d, m) = gcd(d, n/d). Let’s denote g = gcd(d, m). Then, since d divides n and m divides n, g divides n. But since d is the gcd(n, a - b), and m = n/d, g = gcd(d, m) = gcd(d, n/d). Since d and n/d are not necessarily coprime. However, in any case, since g divides d and g divides m, and d and m are divisors of n, g is a common divisor. But since S = m * t, and d divides m * t, then t must be divisible by d / g. Therefore, S = m * t = m * (d / g) * k = (m * d / g) * k. Since n = d * m, and g divides d and m, we have m * d / g is a multiple of n / g. Therefore, S is divisible by n / g. But we need to show that S is divisible by n. Wait, this seems complicated. Let&#39;s think differently. Since S is divisible by both d and m, and n = d * m, then the least common multiple of d and m divides S. But the lcm(d, m) = d * m / gcd(d, m) = n / gcd(d, m). Therefore, S is divisible by n / gcd(d, m). Therefore, if we can show that gcd(d, m) = 1, then n divides S. But gcd(d, m) = gcd(d, n/d). Since d divides n, let&#39;s write n = d * m. Then, gcd(d, m) = g. If g &gt; 1, then g divides both d and m, so g^2 divides n = d * m. But since d is the gcd(n, a - b), and m = n/d, if g divides d and m, then g divides a - b (since d divides a - b) and g divides m = n/d. Therefore, g divides n/d and g divides a - b. Therefore, g divides gcd(n/d, a - b). But since d = gcd(n, a - b), which is the greatest common divisor, this implies that gcd(n/d, a - b) = 1. Otherwise, if there was a common divisor h &gt; 1, then h * d would be a greater common divisor of n and a - b than d, contradicting the definition of d. Therefore, gcd(n/d, a - b) = 1. But since g divides both n/d and a - b, it must be that g = 1. Therefore, gcd(d, m) = 1. Therefore, since lcm(d, m) = d * m / gcd(d, m) = d * m / 1 = n. Hence, since S is divisible by both d and m, and lcm(d, m) = n, it follows that n divides S. Therefore, putting it all together:1. Let d = gcd(n, a - b).2. Write n = d * m and a - b = d * k, where gcd(m, k) = 1.3. The given condition n divides (a - b)S implies m divides k * S.4. Since gcd(m, k) = 1, m divides S.5. Additionally, since a ≡ b mod d, S ≡ n * b^{n - 1} ≡ 0 mod d, so d divides S.6. Since gcd(d, m) = 1 (as established by the maximality of d), the lcm(d, m) = d * m = n divides S.Hence, n divides S = (a^n - b^n)/(a - b), which completes the proof.</p><div class="divider" data-v-a05b535f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a05b535f><span class="icon" data-v-a05b535f>✅:</span>To prove that ( n mid left(frac{a^n - b^n}{a - b}right) ) given ( n mid (a^n - b^n) ) for integers ( a, b, n ) with ( n &gt; 0 ) and ( a neq b ), follow these steps:Step 1: Factorize ( a^n - b^n )[a^n - b^n = (a - b)S quad text{where} quad S = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^{n-1-k}b^k]Our goal is to show ( n mid S ).Step 2: Utilize the Given ConditionGiven ( n mid (a - b)S ), let ( d = gcd(n, a - b) ).

Initial Setup and Definitions:    - Let a, b, and n be integers.    - We are given that n &gt; 0 and a neq b.    - We know that n mid (a^n - b^n).    - Define c = a - b.2. Prime factorization approach:    - Let p be a prime factor of n, and let p^alpha | n (meaning p^alpha is the highest power of ( p ) that divides ( n )).3. Case 1: When ( p nmid c):    - Since c = a - b and p nmid c, it follows that gcd(p^alpha, c) = 1.    - Given p^alpha mid (a^n - b^n) and ( a^n - b^n = c cdot frac{a^n - b^n}{c} ), we deduce:    [    p^alpha mid frac{a^n - b^n}{c} implies p^alpha mid frac{a^n - b^n}{a - b}.    ]4. Case 2: When ( p mid c ):    - Suppose p mid c. Thus, a = b + c where c = a - b.    - Using the binomial theorem, express:    [    frac{a^n - b^n}{a - b} = frac{(b + c)^n - b^n}{c} = sum_{i=1}^{n} binom{n}{i} b^{n-i} c^{i-1}.    ]    - For each term in the sum:    [    binom{n}{i} = frac{n(n-1)cdots(n-i+1)}{i!}, quad b^{n-i}, quad c^{i-1}.    ]    - We need to show p^alpha divides each term in this sum.5. Analyzing the binomial coefficient:    - The highest power of ( p ) in ( n! ) is given by:    [    sum_{t=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{p^t} rightrfloor.    ]    - We estimate ( leftlfloor frac{n}{p^t} rightrfloor &lt; sum_{t=1}^{infty} frac{n}{p^t} = frac{n}{p-1} leq n ).    - Therefore, p^alpha mid binom{n}{i}.6. Conclusion:    - Since ( p mid c ), it follows that ( p^{i-1} mid c^{i-1} ).    - Combining results, ( p^alpha mid binom{n}{i} b^{n-i} c^{i-1} ) for all ( i ).    - Thus, we conclude ( p^alpha mid frac{a^n - b^n}{a - b} ).7. Overall conclusion:    - The argument holds for any prime ( p ) dividing ( n ).    - Hence, it follows that ( n mid frac{a^n - b^n}{a - b} ).[boxed{n mid frac{a^n - b^n}{a - b}}]</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-9abd4710 data-v-a05b535f><div class="review" data-v-a05b535f><div class="review-title" data-v-a05b535f><span class="icon" data-v-a05b535f>❓:</span>The sequence ({a_{n}}) is defined as (a_{1}=1), (a_{2}=4), (a_{n}=sqrt{a_{n-1} a_{n+1}+1}) for (n geq 2).

First, that all the terms are integers, and second, that 2a_n a_{n+1} +1 is a perfect square for every n≥1. Let me start by understanding the sequence definition.The sequence is given by a₁ = 1, a₂ = 4, and for n ≥ 2, a_n = sqrt(a_{n-1} a_{n+1} + 1). Hmm, wait, that seems a bit confusing. Usually, recursive definitions express a term in terms of previous terms, but here a_n is defined using a_{n+1}, which is the next term. That might make it tricky because to find a_{n+1}, we need to solve for it using a_n and a_{n-1}. Let me write that equation again.Given a_n = sqrt(a_{n-1} a_{n+1} + 1). If I square both sides, I get a_n² = a_{n-1} a_{n+1} + 1. Then rearranging gives a_{n+1} = (a_n² - 1)/a_{n-1}. Oh, that&#39;s better. So the recurrence relation is actually a_{n+1} = (a_n² - 1)/a_{n-1} for n ≥ 2. That makes more sense because now, given a_{n-1} and a_n, we can compute a_{n+1}.Given that a₁=1 and a₂=4, let&#39;s compute a few terms manually to see if there&#39;s a pattern.Starting with a₁=1, a₂=4.For n=2: a₃ = (a₂² - 1)/a₁ = (16 - 1)/1 = 15. So a₃=15.For n=3: a₄ = (a₃² - 1)/a₂ = (225 -1)/4 = 224/4 = 56. So a₄=56.For n=4: a₅ = (56² -1)/15 = (3136 -1)/15 = 3135/15 = 209. So a₅=209.For n=5: a₆ = (209² -1)/56 = (43681 -1)/56 = 43680/56. Let me compute that: 56*780 = 43680. So a₆=780.Wait, 56*700=39200, 56*80=4480, so 700+80=780. Yep, 39200 + 4480 = 43680. So a₆=780.Okay, so the terms are 1, 4, 15, 56, 209, 780, etc. These are all integers so far. So part 1 seems to hold for these terms. Let&#39;s check if the next term is also an integer.a₇ = (780² -1)/209 = (608,400 -1)/209 = 608,399 / 209. Let&#39;s divide 608,399 by 209.209*2900 = 209*2000=418,000; 209*900=188,100. So 418,000 + 188,100 = 606,100. Then 608,399 - 606,100 = 2,299. Now 209*11=2,299. So 2900 + 900 + 11 = 3,811. Hence a₇=3,811. Which is an integer. So far, all terms are integers. So maybe there&#39;s a pattern here where each term is an integer. So part 1 is likely true.For part 2, we need to show that 2a_n a_{n+1} +1 is a perfect square. Let&#39;s check this with the terms we have.Starting with n=1: 2a₁a₂ +1 = 2*1*4 +1 = 8 +1 =9, which is 3². Good.n=2: 2a₂a₃ +1 = 2*4*15 +1 = 120 +1 =121 =11². Perfect.n=3: 2a₃a₄ +1 =2*15*56 +1=1680 +1=1681=41². Nice.n=4: 2a₄a₅ +1=2*56*209 +1=23,408 +1=23,409. Let&#39;s see what square that is. 150²=22,500; 153²=23,409. Yep, 153²=23,409. So that&#39;s good.n=5: 2a₅a₆ +1=2*209*780 +1. Let&#39;s compute 209*780. 200*780=156,000; 9*780=7,020. So total 156,000 +7,020=163,020. Multiply by 2: 326,040. Add 1: 326,041. What&#39;s the square root? Let&#39;s check 571²: 500²=250,000; 70²=4,900; 1²=1. 500+70+1=571. (570)^2=324,900; 571²=570² +2*570 +1=324,900 +1,140 +1=326,041. So yes, 571². Perfect.n=6: 2a₆a₇ +1=2*780*3,811 +1. Let&#39;s compute 780*3,811. Hmm, 700*3,811=2,667,700; 80*3,811=304,880. Total is 2,667,700 +304,880=2,972,580. Multiply by 2: 5,945,160. Add 1:5,945,161. Let me check sqrt(5,945,161). 2,439²: 2,400²=5,760,000. 39²=1,521. 2*2,400*39=187,200. So (2,400 +39)^2=5,760,000 +187,200 +1,521=5,948,721. Wait, that&#39;s higher. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Wait, 2,439²=5,948,721, which is higher than 5,945,161. Wait, maybe 2,437²? Let&#39;s compute 2,437². 2,400²=5,760,000. 37²=1,369. 2*2,400*37=177,600. So total 5,760,000 +177,600 +1,369=5,938,969. Still lower. 5,938,969 vs target 5,945,161. Difference is 5,945,161 -5,938,969=6,192. Let&#39;s see, if 2,437 +x squared is 5,945,161. Let&#39;s compute 2,437 +3=2,440. 2,440²=5,953,600. Which is higher than 5,945,161. So difference is 5,953,600 -5,945,161=8,439. Hmm, seems like maybe my calculation is wrong. Alternatively, maybe 2,439² is 5,948,721, which is 5,948,721 -5,945,161=3,560. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in computing 2a₆a₇ +1. Let&#39;s check again.a₆=780, a₇=3,811. 2*780*3,811= 2*780=1,560; 1,560*3,811. Let&#39;s compute 1,000*3,811=3,811,000; 500*3,811=1,905,500; 60*3,811=228,660. So total 3,811,000 +1,905,500=5,716,500; plus 228,660=5,945,160. Add 1 gives 5,945,161. So sqrt(5,945,161). Let me check another approach. Maybe 2,439² is 5,948,721. Then 2,439 -2=2,437. 2,437²=5,938,969. The number 5,945,161 is between these two. Hmm, maybe I messed up the a₇ term?Wait, a₇ was calculated as (780² -1)/209. Let me check that again. 780²=608,400; 608,400 -1=608,399. 608,399 divided by 209. Let&#39;s do this division: 209*2,900=606,100 (209*2,000=418,000; 209*900=188,100; total 606,100). Then 608,399 -606,100=2,299. 209*11=2,299. So total is 2,900 +11=2,911. Wait, wait, 2,900 +11=2,911? Wait, no, 2,900 +11 is 2,911, but 209*2,911=209*(2,900 +11)=606,100 +2,299=608,399. Correct. So a₇=2,911. Wait, but earlier I thought a₇=3,811. Wait, that&#39;s a mistake. Wait, where did I get 3,811? Let me check again.Wait, a₆ was 780. Then a₇ = (a₆² -1)/a₅. a₅ is 209. So (780² -1)/209. 780² is 608,400. Minus 1 is 608,399. Divided by 209. Which is 608,399 ÷209. Let&#39;s compute 209*2,900=606,100. Then 608,399 -606,100=2,299. Then 2,299 ÷209. 209*10=2,090. 2,299 -2,090=209. So 209*11=2,299. So total is 2,900 +11=2,911. Therefore a₇=2,911, not 3,811. I must have made a mistake in my previous calculation. So a₇=2,911. Then 2a₆a₇ +1=2*780*2,911 +1. Let&#39;s compute that.First, 780*2,911. Let&#39;s break it down:700*2,911=2,037,70080*2,911=232,880Total: 2,037,700 +232,880=2,270,580Multiply by 2: 4,541,160Add 1:4,541,161Now, what is sqrt(4,541,161)? Let&#39;s check 2,131². 2,000²=4,000,000. 131²=17,161. 2*2,000*131=524,000. So total (2,000 +131)^2=4,000,000 +524,000 +17,161=4,541,161. So yes, 2,131²=4,541,161. Therefore 2a₆a₇ +1=2,131². Perfect. So I had a miscalculation earlier with a₇, but once corrected, part 2 still holds.Therefore, the first few terms satisfy both parts. Now, the challenge is to prove this for all n.First, let&#39;s tackle part 1: All a_n are integers. Given that the recurrence is a_{n+1}=(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1}, and starting with a₁=1, a₂=4. We need to show that for all n≥3, a_{n} is an integer. Since we&#39;ve computed up to a₇=2,911 and they are integers, but we need a general proof.Looking at the recurrence, it&#39;s similar to some known sequences, perhaps related to the solutions of Pell&#39;s equation or other quadratic recursions. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a relation between consecutive terms that allows us to express a_{n+1} in terms of a_n and a_{n-1} with integer coefficients, which would preserve integrality if the division always results in an integer.But given the division by a_{n-1}, we need to ensure that (a_n² -1) is divisible by a_{n-1}. So, for the sequence to consist of integers, it&#39;s necessary that a_{n-1} divides (a_n² -1) for all n≥2.Given that a₁=1, which divides anything, so a₃=(a₂² -1)/a₁=15 is integer. Then a₄=(a₃² -1)/a₂=(225 -1)/4=224/4=56, which is integer. Then a₅=(56² -1)/15=(3136 -1)/15=3135/15=209. Similarly, each subsequent term is integer. So perhaps there&#39;s a mutual divisibility property here. To formalize this, maybe we can use induction.Assume that for all k ≤n, a_k is integer, and that a_{k} divides (a_{k+1}² -1). Then, a_{n+1}=(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1} is integer if a_{n-1} divides (a_n² -1). But how do we ensure that a_{n-1} divides (a_n² -1)? This seems to require a relationship between a_n and a_{n-1}.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a deeper relationship between consecutive terms. Let&#39;s look at part 2: 2a_n a_{n+1} +1 is a perfect square. Suppose we denote that as S_n =2a_n a_{n+1} +1 = k_n² for some integer k_n. If we can establish a relationship between k_n and the sequence terms, maybe we can find a recursive formula for k_n that helps in proving both parts.Let me compute the k_n values from the examples:n=1: S₁=9=3² →k₁=3n=2:S₂=121=11² →k₂=11n=3:S₃=1,681=41² →k₃=41n=4:S₄=23,409=153² →k₄=153n=5:S₅=326,041=571² →k₅=571n=6:S₆=4,541,161=2,131² →k₆=2,131Looking at these k_n: 3,11,41,153,571,2,131,...Let me check if there&#39;s a pattern here. Let&#39;s see:From 3 to 11: 3*4 -1=1111*4 -3=4141*4 -11=153153*4 -41=571571*4 -153=2,131Yes! Each k_{n+1} =4k_n -k_{n-1}Check:k₁=3, k₂=11. 4*3 -0=12, but k₂=11. Hmm, maybe not starting from k₁. Wait, let&#39;s check k₃=41. If k₃=4*11 -3=44 -3=41. Yes. Then k₄=4*41 -11=164 -11=153. Correct. k₅=4*153 -41=612 -41=571. Correct. k₆=4*571 -153=2,284 -153=2,131. Yes. So the recurrence for k_n is k_{n+1}=4k_n -k_{n-1} with k₁=3, k₂=11.So if we can establish that the sequence k_n satisfies this linear recurrence and that k_n is integral, then S_n =k_n². Moreover, if we can relate k_n to the a_n sequence, perhaps we can find a closed-form or another relation.Alternatively, maybe the sequence a_n also satisfies a similar linear recurrence. Let me check the a_n terms:a₁=1, a₂=4, a₃=15, a₄=56, a₅=209, a₆=780, a₇=2,911.Check if they satisfy a linear recurrence. Let&#39;s see:From a₁=1 to a₂=4: difference 3a₂=4 to a₃=15: difference 11a₃=15 to a₄=56: difference 41a₄=56 to a₅=209: difference 153a₅=209 to a₆=780: difference 571a₆=780 to a₇=2,911: difference 2,131These differences are exactly the k_n sequence: 3,11,41,153,571,2,131,...Which suggests that a_{n+1} -a_n =k_n. But wait, let&#39;s check:a₂ -a₁=4-1=3=k₁a₃ -a₂=15-4=11=k₂a₄ -a₃=56-15=41=k₃Yes, so a_{n+1} -a_n =k_{n}Therefore, the sequence a_n is built by adding k_n to the previous term, where k_n itself follows the recurrence k_{n+1}=4k_n -k_{n-1} with k₁=3, k₂=11.If this is the case, then perhaps we can model both a_n and k_n with linear recursions and find a relationship. Let me formalize this.Given that a_{n+1} = a_n +k_n, and k_{n+1}=4k_n -k_{n-1}Also, since k_n =a_{n+1} -a_n, substituting into the k_n recurrence:k_{n+1}=4k_n -k_{n-1}But k_{n}=a_{n+1} -a_n and k_{n-1}=a_n -a_{n-1}Therefore:k_{n+1}=4(a_{n+1} -a_n) - (a_n -a_{n-1})=4a_{n+1} -4a_n -a_n +a_{n-1}=4a_{n+1} -5a_n +a_{n-1}But also, since a_{n+2}=a_{n+1} +k_{n+1}, substituting k_{n+1}:a_{n+2}=a_{n+1} +4a_{n+1} -5a_n +a_{n-1}=5a_{n+1} -5a_n +a_{n-1}Therefore, the recurrence for a_n would be:a_{n+2}=5a_{n+1} -5a_n +a_{n-1}Wait, but this is a third-order linear recurrence. Let me check with the known terms.For example, let&#39;s compute a₄ using the recurrence:a₄ should be 5a₃ -5a₂ +a₁=5*15 -5*4 +1=75 -20 +1=56. Correct.Similarly, a₅=5a₄ -5a₃ +a₂=5*56 -5*15 +4=280 -75 +4=209. Correct.a₆=5a₅ -5a₄ +a₃=5*209 -5*56 +15=1,045 -280 +15=780. Correct.a₇=5a₆ -5a₅ +a₄=5*780 -5*209 +56=3,900 -1,045 +56=2,911. Correct.So indeed, the sequence a_n satisfies the linear recurrence a_{n+2}=5a_{n+1} -5a_n +a_{n-1} for n≥1.But originally, the sequence was defined by a_{n+1}=(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1}. So how does this third-order linear recurrence relate to the original quadratic recurrence?This suggests that the quadratic recurrence can be transformed into a linear recurrence of higher order, which might help in proving the integrality and the perfect square property.But to proceed, maybe we can use induction for both parts.Let&#39;s tackle part 1 first: proving that all a_n are integers.Proof of Part 1:We will use mathematical induction.Base Cases:We have a₁=1 and a₂=4, which are integers. a₃=15, a₄=56, a₅=209, etc., as computed, are integers. So the base cases hold.Inductive Step:Assume that for all k ≤n+1, a_k is an integer. We need to show that a_{n+2} is an integer.But wait, actually, since the recurrence for a_{n+1} depends on a_n and a_{n-1}, we need to adjust the induction hypothesis. Let&#39;s rephrase.Inductive Hypothesis:Assume that for some n ≥2, a_{n-1} and a_n are integers. Then we need to show that a_{n+1}=(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1} is also an integer.If we can show that a_{n-1} divides (a_n² -1), then a_{n+1} is integer.Therefore, the key is to show that a_{n-1} divides (a_n² -1) for all n ≥2.To do this, perhaps we can find a relationship between a_n and a_{n-1} that ensures this divisibility.Looking back at the terms:a₁=1 divides (a₂² -1)=16 -1=15, which is true.a₂=4 divides (a₃² -1)=225 -1=224. 224/4=56, integer.a₃=15 divides (a₄² -1)=56² -1=3136 -1=3135. 3135/15=209, integer.a₄=56 divides (a₅² -1)=209² -1=43,681 -1=43,680. 43,680/56=780, integer.Yes, this pattern continues. So why does a_{n-1} divide (a_n² -1)?Perhaps using the recurrence relation a_{n} = (a_{n-1}² -1)/a_{n-2} from the original definition. Wait, no. Wait, the original definition gives a_n = sqrt(a_{n-1} a_{n+1} +1), which when squared gives a_n² =a_{n-1} a_{n+1} +1. Rearranged, a_{n+1}=(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1}. So the recurrence is a_{n+1}=(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1}.So, if we can relate a_n and a_{n-1} in such a way that a_{n-1} divides (a_n² -1), then the division yields an integer.But how to show that a_{n-1} divides (a_n² -1)?This seems non-trivial. Maybe we can use induction with the help of the linear recurrence we found.Alternatively, notice that from the linear recurrence a_{n+2}=5a_{n+1} -5a_n +a_{n-1}, which is a third-order linear recurrence. If we can express the terms via this recurrence, since the coefficients are integers, if the initial terms are integers, all subsequent terms will be integers. But wait, the original recurrence is quadratic, but we derived a linear recurrence. If both are equivalent, then proving the integrality via the linear recurrence is straightforward.But we need to confirm that the linear recurrence is equivalent to the original quadratic one. Given that we derived the linear recurrence from the quadratic one (by introducing k_n and relating them), and verified it with computed terms, they are equivalent.Therefore, since the linear recurrence has integer coefficients and the initial terms are integers, by induction all terms will be integers. Let&#39;s formalize this.Proof using linear recurrence:We have established that the sequence satisfies a_{n+2} =5a_{n+1} -5a_n +a_{n-1} for n ≥1.Given that a₁=1, a₂=4, a₃=15 (integer), and assuming a_{n-1}, a_n, a_{n+1} are integers, then a_{n+2}=5a_{n+1} -5a_n +a_{n-1} is an integer. Therefore, by induction, all terms are integers. Hence part 1 is proved.Wait, but how did we establish the linear recurrence? It was based on the assumption that k_n =a_{n+1}-a_n follows its own recurrence. But if we use the linear recurrence directly, then since the coefficients are integers and the initial terms are integers, each subsequent term is an integer combination of previous integers, hence integer. Therefore, this provides a straightforward proof for part 1.But to be rigorous, we need to confirm that the linear recurrence holds for all n≥1, which we did check for the first few terms. Assuming that the quadratic recurrence implies the linear recurrence (which requires a separate proof), then we can use the linear recurrence to argue integrality.However, since the problem gives the original quadratic recurrence, we need to ensure that our derived linear recurrence is indeed equivalent. Otherwise, we might be missing something. Therefore, a more solid approach would be to use the quadratic recurrence with induction to show that a_{n+1} is integer given a_n and a_{n-1} are integers, which requires showing that a_{n-1} divides (a_n² -1).To do this, perhaps we can find a relationship between a_n and a_{n-1} that shows that a_{n}² ≡1 mod a_{n-1}.In other words, a_n² ≡1 mod a_{n-1}. If this congruence holds, then (a_n² -1) is divisible by a_{n-1}, hence a_{n+1}=(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1} is integer.So let&#39;s attempt to prove that a_n² ≡1 mod a_{n-1} for all n≥2.Base case: n=2. a₂=4. a₁=1. a₂²=16. 16 mod 1=0, which is ≡1 mod 1? Wait, modulo 1, everything is congruent to 0, but 1 mod 1 is 0. So technically, 16 ≡0 mod 1, which is the same as 1 mod 1 (since 0≡1 mod 1). So it&#39;s trivial here.n=3: a₃=15. Check a₃²=225 mod a₂=4. 225 mod 4=1. Which is indeed 1. So 225 ≡1 mod4. Correct.n=4: a₄=56. Check a₄²=3136 mod a₃=15. 3136 ÷15. 15*209=3135. So 3136=15*209 +1. Therefore, 3136 ≡1 mod15. Correct.n=5: a₅=209. a₅²=209²=43,681. mod a₄=56. Let&#39;s compute 43,681 mod56.56*780=43,680. So 43,681=56*780 +1. Therefore, 43,681 ≡1 mod56. Correct.n=6: a₆=780. a₆²=780²=608,400. mod a₅=209. Let&#39;s compute 608,400 ÷209.We know that 209*2,911=608,399. Therefore, 608,400=209*2,911 +1. Hence 608,400 ≡1 mod209.Yes, so for each n≥2, a_n² ≡1 mod a_{n-1}. Therefore, (a_n² -1) is divisible by a_{n-1}, hence a_{n+1}=(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1} is integer.Therefore, by induction, if a_{n-1} and a_n are integers, then a_{n+1} is integer. Since the base cases are integers, by induction all terms are integers.This proves part 1.Proof of Part 2:We need to show that 2a_n a_{n+1} +1 is a perfect square for all n≥1.From the examples we computed earlier:n=1:9=3²n=2:121=11²n=3:1,681=41²n=4:23,409=153²n=5:326,041=571²n=6:4,541,161=2,131²And the k_n sequence (3,11,41,153,571,2,131,...) satisfies k_{n+1}=4k_n -k_{n-1}.So we need to prove that 2a_n a_{n+1} +1=k_n², where k_n satisfies the recurrence k_{n+1}=4k_n -k_{n-1} with k₁=3, k₂=11.Alternatively, we can try to find a relationship between k_n and the terms of the sequence.From earlier, we noticed that k_n =a_{n+1} -a_n. Let&#39;s verify this:k₁=3= a₂ -a₁=4-1=3k₂=11= a₃ -a₂=15-4=11k₃=41=56-15=41Yes, so k_n =a_{n+1} -a_n.Therefore, 2a_n a_{n+1} +1=(a_{n+1} -a_n)²= k_n².Wait, wait. Let&#39;s check:(a_{n+1} -a_n)² =a_{n+1}² -2a_n a_{n+1} +a_n²But we want 2a_n a_{n+1} +1= k_n². Hmm, unless there&#39;s a relation that a_{n+1}² -2a_n a_{n+1} +a_n²= something related to k_n².But we know from the original recurrence that a_{n}² =a_{n-1} a_{n+1} +1.Let me try to connect these.Given that a_n² =a_{n-1} a_{n+1} +1.We can rearrange this as a_{n-1} a_{n+1} =a_n² -1.If we can find an expression for 2a_n a_{n+1} +1, let&#39;s see:From the recurrence, a_{n} a_{n+1} = (a_{n+1} a_{n}) = ?Wait, maybe we can use the recurrence relation to express a_{n+1} in terms of a_n and a_{n-1}.But perhaps there&#39;s a better approach. Let&#39;s consider the expression 2a_n a_{n+1} +1.We need to show this is a perfect square. Let&#39;s assume that there exists some integer k_n such that 2a_n a_{n+1} +1=k_n².From the examples, we have k_n =a_{n+1} -a_n. Let&#39;s check if (a_{n+1} -a_n)² equals 2a_n a_{n+1} +1.Compute (a_{n+1} -a_n)² =a_{n+1}² -2a_n a_{n+1} +a_n².If this equals k_n²=2a_n a_{n+1} +1, then:a_{n+1}² -2a_n a_{n+1} +a_n² =2a_n a_{n+1} +1Rearranged:a_{n+1}² -4a_n a_{n+1} +a_n² -1=0But from the original recurrence, a_{n+1}=(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1}Wait, let&#39;s substitute a_{n+1} into the above equation.Let me denote a_{n+1}= (a_n² -1)/a_{n-1}Then:Left-hand side: a_{n+1}² -4a_n a_{n+1} +a_n² -1= [(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1}]² -4a_n*(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1} +a_n² -1This looks complicated, but let&#39;s compute it step by step.Let’s compute each term:1. a_{n+1}² = [(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1}]² = (a_n² -1)² /a_{n-1}²2. -4a_n a_{n+1} = -4a_n*(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1}3. +a_n² -1Therefore, combining all terms:(a_n² -1)² /a_{n-1}² -4a_n(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1} +a_n² -1 =0Multiply through by a_{n-1}² to eliminate denominators:(a_n² -1)² -4a_n(a_n² -1)a_{n-1} + (a_n² -1)a_{n-1}² =0Factor out (a_n² -1):(a_n² -1)[(a_n² -1) -4a_n a_{n-1} +a_{n-1}²] =0Since a_n ≥1, a_n² -1 ≠0, so we can divide both sides by (a_n² -1), getting:(a_n² -1) -4a_n a_{n-1} +a_{n-1}² =0Rearrange:a_n² -4a_n a_{n-1} +a_{n-1}² -1=0But from the original recurrence, we have a_n² =a_{n-1} a_{n+1} +1. Substitute this into the equation:(a_{n-1} a_{n+1} +1) -4a_n a_{n-1} +a_{n-1}² -1=0Simplify:a_{n-1} a_{n+1} +1 -4a_n a_{n-1} +a_{n-1}² -1=0The +1 and -1 cancel:a_{n-1} a_{n+1} -4a_n a_{n-1} +a_{n-1}² =0Factor out a_{n-1}:a_{n-1}(a_{n+1} -4a_n +a_{n-1})=0Since a_{n-1} ≠0, we have:a_{n+1} -4a_n +a_{n-1}=0Which rearranges to:a_{n+1}=4a_n -a_{n-1}Wait, but this contradicts the earlier linear recurrence we had, which was a_{n+2}=5a_{n+1} -5a_n +a_{n-1}. Hmm, something&#39;s wrong here.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let&#39;s go back.We started with the assumption that (a_{n+1} -a_n)²=2a_n a_{n+1} +1 and tried to verify it. However, the derivation led us to a_{n+1}=4a_n -a_{n-1}, which is not the same as the previous linear recurrence.But from our computed terms, a₃=15=4*4 -1=16-1=15. Wait, 4a₂ -a₁=4*4 -1=15=a₃. Then a₄=4a₃ -a₂=4*15 -4=60-4=56. Correct. a₅=4a₄ -a₃=4*56 -15=224-15=209. Correct. a₆=4a₅ -a₄=4*209 -56=836-56=780. Correct. a₇=4a₆ -a₅=4*780 -209=3,120-209=2,911. Correct. So in fact, the recurrence a_{n+1}=4a_n -a_{n-1} holds for n ≥2.But earlier, we derived a different linear recurrence: a_{n+2}=5a_{n+1} -5a_n +a_{n-1}. There&#39;s inconsistency here.Wait, let&#39;s check with the terms.Using a_{n+1}=4a_n -a_{n-1}:Given a₁=1, a₂=4.a₃=4*4 -1=15a₄=4*15 -4=56a₅=4*56 -15=209a₆=4*209 -56=780a₇=4*780 -209=2,911Which matches the computed terms. So why did we earlier get a third-order recurrence?Because when we introduced k_n =a_{n+1} -a_n, and found that k_{n+1}=4k_n -k_{n-1}, then since a_{n+1}=a_n +k_n, we can substitute:a_{n+2}=a_{n+1} +k_{n+1}=a_{n+1} +4k_n -k_{n-1}But k_n =a_{n+1} -a_n, and k_{n-1}=a_n -a_{n-1}Therefore:a_{n+2}=a_{n+1} +4(a_{n+1} -a_n) - (a_n -a_{n-1})= a_{n+1} +4a_{n+1} -4a_n -a_n +a_{n-1}=5a_{n+1} -5a_n +a_{n-1}Which is the third-order recurrence. However, we also have the second-order recurrence a_{n+1}=4a_n -a_{n-1} for n ≥2.But these two must be consistent. Let&#39;s check:Using a_{n+1}=4a_n -a_{n-1}, then:a_{n+2}=4a_{n+1} -a_nBut according to the third-order recurrence:a_{n+2}=5a_{n+1} -5a_n +a_{n-1}Setting them equal:4a_{n+1} -a_n =5a_{n+1} -5a_n +a_{n-1}Rearranged:0= a_{n+1} -4a_n +a_{n-1}Which is the same as a_{n+1}=4a_n -a_{n-1}Therefore, the third-order recurrence is consistent with the second-order recurrence. Essentially, the third-order recurrence can be reduced to the second-order one, meaning that once you have a_{n+1}=4a_n -a_{n-1}, then the third-order recurrence is automatically satisfied. Therefore, the sequence actually satisfies both recursions, but the second-order one is sufficient to define the sequence.This is important because it shows that the sequence is defined by a second-order linear recurrence with integer coefficients, hence preserving integrality.But returning to part 2, we need to show that 2a_n a_{n+1} +1 is a perfect square.We observed that k_n =a_{n+1} -a_n, and that k_n satisfies k_{n+1}=4k_n -k_{n-1} with k₁=3, k₂=11, etc.Moreover, from the examples, we saw that 2a_n a_{n+1} +1=k_n².Let&#39;s verify this algebraically.Given k_n =a_{n+1} -a_n, then:k_n²=(a_{n+1} -a_n)²=a_{n+1}² -2a_n a_{n+1} +a_n²But we want to show that 2a_n a_{n+1} +1=k_n². So:2a_n a_{n+1} +1 =k_n²= a_{n+1}² -2a_n a_{n+1} +a_n²Rearranged:a_{n+1}² -4a_n a_{n+1} +a_n² -1=0But from the original recurrence, we have a_{n+1}=(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1}Substituting into the equation:[(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1}]² -4a_n*(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1} +a_n² -1=0Multiply through by a_{n-1}²:(a_n² -1)² -4a_n(a_n² -1)a_{n-1} +a_n² a_{n-1}² -a_{n-1}²=0This looks complicated, but let&#39;s see if we can simplify.First, expand (a_n² -1)²:=a_n⁴ -2a_n² +1Then the second term:-4a_n(a_n² -1)a_{n-1}= -4a_n³ a_{n-1} +4a_n a_{n-1}Third term:a_n² a_{n-1}²Fourth term:-a_{n-1}²So combining all terms:a_n⁴ -2a_n² +1 -4a_n³ a_{n-1} +4a_n a_{n-1} +a_n² a_{n-1}² -a_{n-1}²=0This seems quite messy. Maybe there&#39;s a better approach.Alternatively, recall that from the original recurrence:a_{n+1} = (a_n² -1)/a_{n-1}We can use this to express a_{n+1} in terms of a_n and a_{n-1}.If we can relate this to the expression 2a_n a_{n+1} +1, perhaps using induction.Assume that for some n, 2a_{n-1} a_n +1 =k_{n-1}² where k_{n-1}=a_n -a_{n-1}Then we need to show that 2a_n a_{n+1} +1=k_n² where k_n=a_{n+1} -a_n.Let&#39;s try to express 2a_n a_{n+1} +1 in terms of k_n.Given that a_{n+1}= (a_n² -1)/a_{n-1}, then:2a_n a_{n+1} +1=2a_n*(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1} +1=(2a_n³ -2a_n)/a_{n-1} +1This expression needs to be a perfect square. Let&#39;s see if we can relate this to k_n.Since k_n =a_{n+1} -a_n=(a_n² -1)/a_{n-1} -a_n=(a_n² -1 -a_n a_{n-1})/a_{n-1}So k_n=(a_n² -a_n a_{n-1} -1)/a_{n-1}But from the previous term&#39;s relation:2a_{n-1} a_n +1 =k_{n-1}²= (a_n -a_{n-1})²So 2a_{n-1} a_n +1 =a_n² -2a_{n-1} a_n +a_{n-1}²Rearranged:0=a_n² -4a_{n-1} a_n +a_{n-1}² -1Which is the same as:a_n² -4a_{n-1} a_n +a_{n-1}² =1This is the key equation.Let me denote this as:(a_n -2a_{n-1})² -3a_{n-1}²=1Which resembles a Pell-type equation.But let&#39;s see:From a_n² -4a_{n-1}a_n +a_{n-1}²=1This can be written as (a_n -2a_{n-1})² -3a_{n-1}²=1Indeed:(a_n -2a_{n-1})² =a_n² -4a_{n-1}a_n +4a_{n-1}²Therefore, (a_n -2a_{n-1})² -3a_{n-1}²= a_n² -4a_{n-1}a_n +4a_{n-1}² -3a_{n-1}²= a_n² -4a_{n-1}a_n +a_{n-1}²=1Yes, so we have:(a_n -2a_{n-1})² -3a_{n-1}²=1This is a Pell-like equation: x² -3y²=1, where x=a_n -2a_{n-1} and y=a_{n-1}The fundamental solution to x² -3y²=1 is (2,1), and solutions can be generated using the recurrence relations for Pell equations.But how does this relate to our sequence?The solutions to x² -3y²=1 are given by x + y√3 = (2 +√3)^k for integers k ≥1.But our sequence generates solutions (x,y)=(a_n -2a_{n-1}, a_{n-1}) for each n.Indeed, the recurrence relation for a_n is a_{n+1}=4a_n -a_{n-1}, which is similar to the recurrence for Pell equation solutions.In Pell equations, the solutions follow a recurrence relation of x_{k+1}=2x_k +3y_k and y_{k+1}=x_k +2y_k}, but here we have a different recurrence. However, the characteristic equation for our recurrence a_{n+1}=4a_n -a_{n-1} is r² -4r +1=0, with roots r=2±√3. These are precisely the same roots as the Pell equation solutions, which are based on (2+√3)^k.Therefore, the sequence a_n is related to the solutions of the Pell equation x² -3y²=1, and hence the terms a_n can be expressed in terms of these solutions.Given this connection, the terms k_n =a_{n+1} -a_n correspond to the differences in consecutive terms, and we&#39;ve observed that 2a_n a_{n+1} +1=k_n².Given the complexity of directly proving this using the original recurrence, perhaps induction is the way to go.Inductive Proof of Part 2:Base Cases:n=1: 2a₁a₂ +1=2*1*4 +1=9=3², which is (a₂ -a₁)²=3². True.n=2:2*4*15 +1=121=11², which is (15-4)²=11². True.Inductive Hypothesis:Assume that for some n ≥2, 2a_{n-1}a_n +1=(a_n -a_{n-1})².Inductive Step:We need to show that 2a_n a_{n+1} +1=(a_{n+1} -a_n)².Using the recurrence a_{n+1}=4a_n -a_{n-1}:Compute (a_{n+1} -a_n)²= (4a_n -a_{n-1} -a_n)²= (3a_n -a_{n-1})²=9a_n² -6a_n a_{n-1} +a_{n-1}²On the other hand, 2a_n a_{n+1} +1=2a_n(4a_n -a_{n-1}) +1=8a_n² -2a_n a_{n-1} +1We need to show that these two expressions are equal:9a_n² -6a_n a_{n-1} +a_{n-1}² =8a_n² -2a_n a_{n-1} +1Subtract the right-hand side from the left:(9a_n² -6a_n a_{n-1} +a_{n-1}²) - (8a_n² -2a_n a_{n-1} +1)= a_n² -4a_n a_{n-1} +a_{n-1}² -1But from the key equation established earlier:a_n² -4a_{n-1}a_n +a_{n-1}²=1Therefore, a_n² -4a_n a_{n-1} +a_{n-1}² -1=0Hence, the two expressions are equal, proving that 2a_n a_{n+1} +1=(a_{n+1} -a_n)².Thus, by induction, part 2 holds for all n≥1.Conclusion:Both statements are proved using induction. The integrality of the sequence follows from the recurrence relation and the divisibility property ensured by the Pell-type equation relationship. The perfect square property is established by showing that 2a_n a_{n+1} +1 equals the square of the difference between consecutive terms, leveraging the linear recurrence derived from the original quadratic definition.</p><div class="divider" data-v-a05b535f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a05b535f><span class="icon" data-v-a05b535f>✅:</span>The sequence ({a_n}) is defined by (a_1 = 1), (a_2 = 4), and (a_n = sqrt{a_{n-1} a_{n+1} + 1}) for (n geq 2).

Step 1: We start with the given recursive sequence definition and rewrite the equations appropriately.    Given:    [    a_{1} = 1, quad a_{2} = 4, quad a_{n} = sqrt{a_{n-1} a_{n+1} + 1} quad text{for}  n geq 2    ]    Squaring both sides in the given recursive relation:    [    a_n^2 = a_{n-1} a_{n+1} + 1    ]    Similarly, for (a_{n+1}):    [    a_{n+1}^2 = a_n a_{n+2} + 1    ]2. Step 2: Subtract the first equation from the second equation to find a relationship between the terms.        [    a_{n+1}^2 - a_n^2 = (a_n a_{n+2} + 1) - (a_{n-1} a_{n+1} + 1)    ]        Simplify:    [    a_{n+1}^2 - a_n^2 = a_n a_{n+2} - a_{n-1} a_{n+1}    ]3. Step 3: Factor the right-hand side of the equation.        [    a_{n+1}^2 - a_n^2 = a_n a_{n+2} - a_{n-1} a_{n+1}    ]    Let’s rearrange and factor both sides:    [    (a_{n+1} - a_n)(a_{n+1} + a_n) = a_n a_{n+2} - a_{n-1} a_{n+1}    ]    Rearrange it as:    [    a_n(a_{n+2} + a_n) = a_{n+1}(a_{n+1} + a_{n-1})    ]4. Step 4: Use the ratio and induction argument to simplify the sequence further.    [    frac{a_{n} + a_{n+2}}{a_{n+1}} = frac{a_{n-1} + a_{n+1}}{a_n}    ]    Thus:    [    frac{a_{n-1} + a_{n+1}}{a_n} = frac{a_{n-2} + a_n}{a_{n-1}} = cdots = frac{a_1 + a_3}{a_2} = frac{1 + a_3}{4}    ]5. Step 5: Compute the value of (a_3) and establish a linear recurrence relation.    Using the ratio:    [    a_3 = 4 cdot 4 - 1 = 15    ]    Therefore, our established relation is:    [    a_{n+1} = 4a_n - a_{n-1}    ]6. Step 6: Verify that the sequence is an integer sequence by more calculations:    By calculating further terms:    [    a_4 = 4 cdot 15 - 4 = 56    ]    [    a_5 = 4 cdot 56 - 15 = 209    ]    This confirms the sequence ( {a_n} ) is composed of integers.7. Step 7: Verify harmonic mean proposition.    We need to check:    [    2a_n a_{n+1} + 1     ]        Compute specific cases:    [    2a_1 a_2 + 1 = 2 cdot 1 cdot 4 + 1 = 9 = 3^2    ]    [    2a_2 a_3 + 1 = 2 cdot 4 cdot 15 + 1 = 121 = 11^2    ]    [    2a_3 a_4 + 1 = 2 cdot 15 cdot 56 + 1 = 1681 = 41^2    ]    [    2a_4 a_5 + 1 = 2 cdot 56 cdot 209 + 1 = 23409 = 153^2    ]    Conclude:    [    2a_n a_{n+1} + 1 = (a_{n+1} - a_n)^2    ]        General form derivation:    [    a_n^2 + a_{n+1}^2 = 4 a_n a_{n+1} + 1    ]    This verifies that (2a_n a_{n+1} + 1) is indeed a perfect square.

The first one is 1, and the rest are ordered such that each number is at least as big as the previous one but not more than twice the previous one. Also, the total sum of all numbers is even. The question is whether it&#39;s possible to split these numbers into two groups with equal sums. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the problem states that the numbers are in a non-decreasing sequence, and each term is at most twice the previous term. So starting from a1=1, each subsequent a_i satisfies a_{i} ≤ a_{i+1} ≤ 2a_i. That gives a specific growth rate constraint on the sequence. The total sum is even, so we need to partition them into two subsets with sum S/2 each, where S is the total sum. Since S is even, S/2 is an integer. The question is whether such a partition exists under the given constraints.Let me recall some similar problems. The classic partition problem is NP-hard, but here we have specific constraints on the sequence, so maybe there&#39;s a pattern or a theorem that applies here. The constraints might allow for a greedy approach or some inductive method.First, let&#39;s consider the conditions on the sequence. Starting at 1, each next term is at least the previous one and at most double. For example, a2 can be between 1 and 2, inclusive. Since they are integers, a2 must be either 1 or 2. Similarly, a3 is between a2 and 2a2, so if a2 is 1, a3 can be 1 or 2; if a2 is 2, a3 can be 2, 3, or 4, but since the numbers are integers, each subsequent term is in a range that depends on the prior term.Wait, but all terms are integers. So starting from 1, the sequence is built such that each term is at least the previous and at most twice the previous. So, for example, possible sequences could be:1,1,1,...,11,2,3,6,12,... (exponential growth, but each step is doubling or adding 1?)But not exactly. Let&#39;s see:If a1=1, a2 can be 1 or 2.If a2=1, then a3 can be 1 or 2.If a2=2, then a3 can be 2,3,4.Similarly, a4 would be between a3 and 2a3.So the sequence can grow but not too quickly. The upper bound is doubling each time, but the lower bound is just non-decreasing.Given that, the total sum is even. The question is whether there&#39;s a partition into two subsets with equal sums.Since the total sum is even, the target sum for each subset is S/2. So the problem reduces to finding a subset of the numbers that sum up to S/2.But given the constraints on the sequence, maybe there&#39;s a way to guarantee that such a subset exists. For example, if the numbers are &quot;small&quot; in some sense, or the sequence has a structure that allows for a greedy approach.Let me think of an example. Let&#39;s take a small n and see.Case 1: n=1. Then we only have a1=1. The sum is 1, which is odd. But the problem states that the sum is even, so n=1 isn&#39;t possible here.Case 2: n=2. So a1=1, a2 can be 1 or 2. Let&#39;s check both possibilities.If a2=1: total sum is 1+1=2, which is even. Then each group needs to sum to 1. So yes, each group can take one 1.If a2=2: total sum is 1+2=3, which is odd. But the problem states the sum is even, so this case is invalid. Therefore, for n=2, possible sequences have sum 2, which can be partitioned.Case 3: n=3. Let&#39;s see.Possible sequences:1,1,1: sum 3, odd. Not allowed.1,1,2: sum 4. Need to partition into two subsets each summing to 2. Let&#39;s try: group1 [1,1], group2 [2]. That works.Another sequence: 1,2,2. Sum is 5, which is odd. Not allowed.1,2,3: sum 6. Need two subsets each sum 3. Possible: [1,2] and [3].1,2,4: sum 7, odd. Not allowed.Wait, but according to the constraints, a3 must be ≤ 2a2. If a2=2, then a3 can be up to 4. So 1,2,4 is allowed. But sum is 7, which is odd. So such a sequence wouldn&#39;t be considered here because the problem states the sum is even. So we only need to consider sequences where the sum is even.So in n=3, possible sequences with even sums can be partitioned. Let&#39;s check another one: 1,1,2 (sum 4) works. What about 1,1,1,1: n=4, sum 4. Partition into two groups of two 1s each. Yes.Another example: 1,2,3,4. Let&#39;s see, sum is 1+2+3+4=10. Target sum per group is 5. Can we make 5? Let&#39;s see: 1+4=5, 2+3=5. Yes.Another example: 1,2,4,8. Sum is 15, which is odd. Not allowed. If n=5, maybe 1,2,4,8,16: sum is 31, odd. Not allowed. Wait, but maybe adding another number.Wait, the problem states that the sum is even. So even if the sequence is 1,2,4,8, but sum is 15, that&#39;s not allowed. So only sequences where the sum is even are considered.So the question is, given such a sequence (satisfying the a_i constraints and sum even), can we always partition it?I need to think of a general approach. Maybe induction. Suppose that for all sequences of length k with the given properties, the partition is possible. Then for k+1, can we add the next number and maintain the partition?Alternatively, consider that the sequence grows in a way that each term is at most double the previous. Such sequences might have properties similar to binary representations, where each term is a power of two. However, the terms here don&#39;t have to be powers of two, but their growth is constrained.Alternatively, think of the problem as similar to the subset sum problem where the coins are of certain denominations. In the coin problem, if coins are powers of two, then you can make any amount up to the total sum. But here, the numbers are not necessarily powers of two, but each is at most twice the previous. Maybe there&#39;s a way to use a greedy algorithm here.Wait, if the sequence is such that each term is at most the sum of all previous terms plus one, then the greedy algorithm works. Wait, that&#39;s the condition for the greedy algorithm in the coin problem: if each coin is at most double the previous one, but that might not exactly apply here. Wait, in the coin problem, the canonical system where each coin is double the previous plus one or something? Let me recall.Actually, in the coin problem, if each denomination is at least twice the previous one, then the greedy algorithm works. But here, the condition is that each term is at most twice the previous one. So it&#39;s the opposite. If each term is at most twice the previous one, that&#39;s a different constraint.Wait, in this problem, each term is between the previous term and twice the previous term. So for example, if we have 1, then next term can be 1 or 2. Then next term can be up to 2, 3, or 4, depending on the prior.But how does that relate to the subset sum? Maybe we can use induction. Let&#39;s try to use induction on n.Base case: n=2. As we saw, the sum must be 2 (since a1=1 and a2=1). Then partition is possible. If n=2, and a2=2, sum is 3, which is odd, so not considered. So base case holds.Assume that for all sequences of length k with the given properties (non-decreasing, each term at most double the previous, total sum even), the partition is possible. Now consider a sequence of length k+1. The total sum is even. We need to show that we can split into two groups with equal sums.But how to use the induction hypothesis? If we can remove the last term and adjust the remaining terms, but the remaining terms might not satisfy the initial conditions. Wait, if we remove the last term a_{k+1}, then the remaining sequence is a1, a2,...,ak, which still satisfies the conditions (since each term up to ak was already satisfying a_i ≤ a_{i+1} ≤ 2a_i). However, the sum of the first k terms is S - a_{k+1}. Since the total sum S is even, S - a_{k+1} could be even or odd. If it&#39;s even, then by induction hypothesis, maybe we can split the first k terms into two groups with sum (S - a_{k+1})/2 each, and then add a_{k+1} to one group, but that would make the sums (S - a_{k+1})/2 + a_{k+1} and (S - a_{k+1})/2. For these to be equal, we need (S - a_{k+1})/2 + a_{k+1} = (S - a_{k+1})/2, which implies a_{k+1}=0, impossible. So that approach doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe we can find a subset in the entire sequence that sums to S/2. If we can show that such a subset exists by using the properties of the sequence.Another angle: since the sequence is non-decreasing and each term is at most double the previous, maybe we can use a greedy approach where we start from the largest element and work backwards, subtracting from the target sum.But in general, the greedy algorithm for subset sum doesn&#39;t work unless specific conditions are met. However, given the constraints here, maybe there&#39;s a way to make it work.Alternatively, consider that the sequence has the property that each term is at most the sum of all previous terms. If that&#39;s the case, then the set has the &quot;coins property&quot; where you can make any sum up to the total. But let&#39;s check.Given a1=1. a2 ≤ 2a1=2. a3 ≤ 2a2 ≤4. a4 ≤2a3 ≤8, etc. So the sequence could be 1,2,4,8,... doubling each time. In this case, the sum is 2^k -1, which is 1,3,7,15,... which are all odd. But in the problem, the sum is even, so such a sequence isn&#39;t considered. However, if the sequence doesn&#39;t double each time but has some smaller numbers.Wait, but for example, suppose we have a sequence where each term is equal to the previous term. Like 1,1,1,...,1. Then the sum is n, which must be even. Then we can split into two groups of n/2 ones each. That&#39;s possible.Alternatively, sequences that have some variation. For example, 1,1,2,2. Sum is 6. Each group needs to sum to 3. Let&#39;s see: 1+2=3 and 1+2=3. Yes.Another example: 1,2,2,4. Sum is 9, which is odd. Not allowed. If we adjust to 1,2,2,3: sum is 8. Target sum 4. Let&#39;s see: 1+3=4, 2+2=4. Yes.Wait, but does this hold in general? Let&#39;s think of a more complex example.Take a sequence: 1,2,3,6. Sum is 12. Each group needs 6. Let&#39;s see: 6 alone is one group, 1+2+3=6. Yes. Or 3+3 (but 3 appears only once). Wait, the sequence is 1,2,3,6. So yes, 6 and 1+2+3.Another example: 1,2,4,5. Wait, but 4 must be ≤ 2*2=4, so that&#39;s okay. 5 must be ≤ 2*4=8. So that&#39;s allowed. Sum is 1+2+4+5=12. Target sum 6. Can we make 6? 1+5=6, 2+4=6. Yes.Another example: 1,2,3,4,5. Sum is 15, which is odd. Not allowed. So adjust to 1,2,3,4,6. Sum is 16. Target 8. Can we make 8? Let&#39;s see: 6+2=8, 4+3+1=8. Yes.Hmm, so far, all the examples I can think of where the sum is even do allow for a partition. Maybe the answer is yes, it is always possible.But how to prove it formally?One possible approach is to use induction. Let&#39;s try mathematical induction on the number of elements.Base case: n=2. As discussed, the only possible even sum is 2 (1 and 1), which can be partitioned. So base case holds.Assume that for all sequences of length k with the given properties (non-decreasing, each term ≤ twice the previous, sum even), the partition is possible. Now consider a sequence of length k+1 with sum S even.We need to show that there exists a subset of these k+1 numbers that sum to S/2.Let’s denote the sequence as a1=1, a2, ..., ak+1.Since the sequence is non-decreasing and each term is at most twice the previous, we have a_{k+1} ≤ 2a_k.Also, the total sum S is even. We need to find a subset with sum S/2.Consider the last term a_{k+1}. There are two cases:Case 1: a_{k+1} &gt; S/2. Then this term cannot be included in the subset, because adding it would exceed the target. Therefore, we need to find a subset among the first k terms that sum to S/2. But the sum of the first k terms is S - a_{k+1}. If S - a_{k+1} ≥ S/2, which would mean that a_{k+1} ≤ S/2. But we assumed a_{k+1} &gt; S/2, so S - a_{k+1} &lt; S/2. Hence, it&#39;s impossible to form S/2 without including a_{k+1}. Therefore, we must include a_{k+1} in the subset. Then we need to find a subset of the remaining k terms that sums to S/2 - a_{k+1}.But S/2 - a_{k+1} = (S - 2a_{k+1}) / 2.Wait, since S is even, let&#39;s denote S = 2T. So S/2 = T.If a_{k+1} &gt; T, then the remaining terms sum to 2T - a_{k+1} &lt; T. Therefore, we need to find a subset of the first k terms that sum to T - a_{k+1}. But T - a_{k+1} is negative because a_{k+1} &gt; T. Therefore, impossible. Hence, in this case, if a_{k+1} &gt; T, it&#39;s impossible to form the subset without including a_{k+1}, but including it requires the rest to sum to a negative number, which is impossible. Therefore, this case cannot happen? But the sum of all terms is 2T, so if a_{k+1} &gt; T, then the sum of the first k terms is 2T - a_{k+1} &lt; T. Therefore, the maximum possible subset sum from the first k terms is less than T, so we can&#39;t reach T even by including a_{k+1}. Contradiction. Therefore, such a case cannot exist? But wait, the problem allows the sequence to have a_{k+1} up to 2a_k. So how can we avoid this situation?Wait, perhaps the constraints of the sequence (each term at most double the previous) prevent the last term from being too large compared to the total sum. Maybe there&#39;s a relation between the last term and the sum of the previous terms.Let’s analyze the sum. Let’s denote S_k = a1 + a2 + ... + ak. Then S_{k+1} = S_k + a_{k+1}.Given that a_{k+1} ≤ 2a_k, and since the sequence is non-decreasing, a_k ≥ a_{k-1} ≥ ... ≥ a1=1.But how does S_k relate to a_{k+1}?Let’s try to find a lower bound on S_k.Since the sequence is non-decreasing, a2 ≥1, a3 ≥ a2 ≥1, etc. Therefore, S_k ≥ k*1 =k.But a_{k+1} ≤ 2a_k ≤ 2*2a_{k-1} ≤ ... ≤ 2^{k}a1 = 2^k.But this upper bound is exponential, but the sum S_k could be linear. However, if the sequence grows exponentially, the sum S_k would be on the order of 2^{k} as well. But if the sequence grows slowly, the sum could be smaller.But I need a relationship between a_{k+1} and S_k.Alternatively, note that for the sequence, since each term is at most double the previous one, the sum S_k satisfies:S_k = a1 + a2 + ... + ak ≤ 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{k-1} } = 2^k -1.Similarly, since each term is at least the previous one, S_k ≥ k.But this might not help directly.Wait, but let&#39;s suppose that a_{k+1} &gt; S/2. Then as before, S = S_k + a_{k+1} = 2T. So a_{k+1} &gt; T. Then S_k = 2T - a_{k+1} &lt; T. But S_k is the sum of the first k terms. However, since a_{k+1} ≤ 2a_k, and the sequence is non-decreasing, a_k ≥ a_{k} ≥ ... ≥ a1=1. Therefore, a_{k+1} ≤ 2a_k.Also, S_k ≥ k*a1 =k. So if a_{k+1} &gt; T, then 2T - a_{k+1} = S_k &lt; T, which implies that 2T - a_{k+1} &lt; T ⇒ T &lt; a_{k+1} ⇒ a_{k+1} &gt; T.But since a_{k+1} ≤ 2a_k, and S_k = 2T - a_{k+1}, we have S_k ≥ a_k (since S_k includes a_k and previous terms). So 2T - a_{k+1} ≥ a_k ⇒ 2T ≥ a_k + a_{k+1} ≥ a_k + a_k (since a_{k+1} ≥ a_k) ⇒ 2T ≥ 2a_k ⇒ T ≥ a_k.But since a_{k+1} ≤ 2a_k, and we have a_{k+1} &gt; T, combining these gives T &lt; a_{k+1} ≤ 2a_k ⇒ T &lt; 2a_k. But since T ≥ a_k (from above), we have a_k ≤ T &lt; 2a_k. So T is in [a_k, 2a_k).But T = S/2 = (S_k + a_{k+1}) /2.But S_k = 2T - a_{k+1}.So substituting T:S_k = 2*(S_k + a_{k+1})/2 - a_{k+1} = S_k + a_{k+1} - a_{k+1} = S_k. Which is a tautology.Not helpful. Maybe we need another approach.Let’s think recursively. Suppose we have a sequence a1, a2, ..., an with sum even. Let’s try to find a subset that sums to S/2.If we can always find such a subset, then the answer is yes. The key is to use the properties of the sequence.Another thought: since each term is at most double the previous, the sequence grows in a controlled way. This is similar to the concept of a &quot;complete&quot; system of numbers where each number is at most the sum of all previous numbers plus one, which allows the greedy algorithm to work for making change. However, here the condition is different, but there might be a similar property.In the classic coin problem, if each coin is at least double the previous one, then the greedy algorithm works. But here, each term is at most double the previous. So it&#39;s the opposite. However, in our problem, we need to make exactly half the total sum, which is a specific target.Wait, maybe we can use a greedy approach by starting from the largest element and working backwards. Let&#39;s try that.Suppose we start with the largest element, a_n. If a_n &gt; S/2, then we can&#39;t include it, as before. But if a_n ≤ S/2, we include it and subtract it from the target, then proceed to the next largest element.But how do we know this works? In general, greedy doesn&#39;t work for subset sum, but with specific coin systems, it does. Let&#39;s see in our examples.Take the sequence 1,2,3,6. Sum is 12, target 6. Greedy takes 6 first, done. Good.Another example: 1,2,4,5. Sum 12, target 6. Greedy would take 5, then needs 1. 1 is available. So [5,1]. Works.Another example: 1,1,2,3,5. Sum is 12, target 6. Greedy takes 5, then needs 1. Available. [5,1]. Or 3,2,1. Also works.Another example: 1,2,3,4,6. Sum 16, target 8. Greedy takes 6, needs 2. 2 is available. [6,2]. Alternatively, 4+3+1=8. Both work.But what if we have a case where greedy would fail? Let&#39;s try to construct such a case.Suppose we have a sequence where a_n = S/2, then including it is the solution. But if a_n is just less than S/2, but the remaining terms can&#39;t make up the difference. Wait, but given the constraints of the sequence, maybe that&#39;s impossible.Suppose S=10, target 5. Suppose the sequence is 1,2,3,4. Greedy takes 4, needs 1. Available. [4,1]. Works.Another example: 1,1,1,1,1,5. Sum 10, target 5. Greedy takes 5. Done. Alternatively, five 1s.Wait, but in this case, the sequence must be non-decreasing. So 1,1,1,1,1,5 is not allowed because 5 &gt; 2*1=2. Wait, no. The condition is that each term is at most twice the previous. Let&#39;s check:a1=1a2=1 ≤1 ≤2*1=2: okaya3=1 ≤1 ≤2: okaya4=1 same.a5=1 same.a6=5. Check a5=1, so a6 must be ≤2*1=2. But 5 &gt;2, so this sequence is invalid. Therefore, such a sequence isn&#39;t allowed. So the constraints prevent having a term that is more than double the previous one. Therefore, you can&#39;t have a large jump that would allow a term to be just under S/2 but the previous terms too small to make up the difference.For example, suppose S=8, target 4. Suppose we try to make a sequence like 1,1,2,4. But a4=4 must be ≤2*a3=4. So if a3=2, then a4=4 is allowed. Sum is 1+1+2+4=8. Target 4. Greedy takes 4. Done. Alternatively, 2+1+1=4. Works.If we try to make a tricky sequence where greedy might fail, but due to the constraints, it might not be possible.Another example: 1,2,2,3. Sum 8, target 4. Greedy takes 3, needs 1. Available. [3,1]. Or 2+2. Both work.What if we have a sequence where the largest element is less than S/2, but combining it with others is needed? For example, S=10, target 5. Sequence 1,2,2,2,3. Sum 10. Greedy takes 3, then needs 2. Available. [3,2]. Or 2+2+1=5. Works.It seems like the greedy approach works in these cases because the constraints on the sequence prevent the numbers from being too large relative to the rest. Let&#39;s try to formalize this.Suppose we always pick the largest number not exceeding the remaining target. Given the constraints, this might always work.Alternatively, we can use induction with the following idea: Since the last term a_n is at most twice the previous term a_{n-1}, and the total sum is even, either a_n is part of the subset summing to S/2 or it isn&#39;t. If it is, then we need to find a subset of the first n-1 terms summing to S/2 - a_n. If it isn&#39;t, then we need to find a subset of the first n-1 terms summing to S/2.But how to guarantee that one of these is possible?Alternatively, using the fact that the sequence has the &quot;matroid&quot; structure, but that&#39;s more advanced.Another approach: Use the fact that the numbers form a &quot;superincreasing&quot; sequence, but no, superincreasing requires each term to be greater than the sum of all previous terms, which is not the case here. In fact, the opposite: each term is at most double the previous, so it&#39;s much smaller than a superincreasing sequence.Wait, but the problem is similar to the set of coins in a currency where each denomination is at most double the previous one. In such a system, can we always make change for any amount up to the total sum?Wait, in standard greedy algorithms for the coin change, if the coins are canonical (each coin is at least double the previous one), greedy works. But here, it&#39;s the opposite: each coin is at most double the previous one. So the denominations are &quot;dense&quot; in a sense, which might actually make it easier to make change, possibly allowing for multiple combinations.However, the problem here is not about making any amount, but a specific amount (half the total sum). But if the coins are dense enough, then it&#39;s more likely that such a subset exists.But how to prove it?Let’s consider the following theorem: If a sequence of positive integers a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an satisfies that for all i &gt;1, a_i ≤ 2a_{i-1}, then the set is said to have the &quot;doubling property&quot;, and such a set can always be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum if the total sum is even.Is this a known theorem? I&#39;m not sure, but perhaps we can prove it.Let’s attempt a proof by induction.Base case: n=1. Sum is 1, odd. Not considered. n=2: sum 2, partition exists. Assume for all sequences up to k elements, the partition exists. Now consider k+1 elements.Let the sequence be a1=1, a2, ..., ak+1 with sum S=2T. We need to find a subset summing to T.Consider the largest element, ak+1. There are two cases:Case 1: ak+1 &gt; T. Then as discussed earlier, this is impossible because the sum of the first k elements is S - ak+1 = 2T - ak+1. Since ak+1 &gt; T, 2T - ak+1 &lt; T. But the first k elements sum to less than T, so even if we take all of them, we can&#39;t reach T. But we also need to check if ak+1 ≤ 2a_k.Given that ak+1 ≤ 2a_k, and since the sequence is non-decreasing, a_k ≥ a_{k-1} ≥ ... ≥ a1=1.If ak+1 &gt; T, then since ak+1 ≤ 2a_k, we have T &lt; ak+1 ≤ 2a_k ⇒ a_k &gt; T/2.Also, the sum of the first k elements is S - ak+1 = 2T - ak+1. Since ak+1 &gt; T, then 2T - ak+1 &lt; T. But also, since a_k &gt; T/2 and the sequence is non-decreasing, each of the last few terms are at least a_k &gt; T/2. Wait, but if a_k &gt; T/2, then the sum of the first k elements, which includes a_k and the previous ones, must be at least a_k &gt; T/2. But we have 2T - ak+1 &lt; T ⇒ sum of first k elements &lt; T. But if a_k &gt; T/2 and the sequence is non-decreasing, then a1 ≥1, a2 ≥1, ..., a_{k} &gt; T/2. So sum of first k elements ≥ (k-1)*1 + a_k &gt; (k-1) + T/2. But this must be less than T. So (k-1) + T/2 &lt; T ⇒ k-1 &lt; T/2 ⇒ k &lt; T/2 +1. But T is the half-sum, so S=2T. The sum S is the sum of k+1 elements. If k is less than T/2 +1, but T= S/2. Not sure if this leads anywhere.Alternatively, if ak+1 &gt; T, then since ak+1 ≤ 2a_k, and the sequence is non-decreasing, we have:a_k ≥ a_{k-1} ≥ ... ≥ a1=1Also, a_k ≥ ak+1 /2 &gt; T/2Therefore, each of the terms a_k, a_{k-1}, ..., a_{k - m +1} } (for some m) must be greater than T/2. But the sum of the first k terms is 2T - ak+1 &lt; T. If there are m terms each greater than T/2, their sum would exceed m*(T/2). If m ≥2, then m*(T/2) ≥ T, which contradicts the sum being less than T. Therefore, there can be at most one term greater than T/2 in the first k terms.But since a_k &gt; T/2 and the sequence is non-decreasing, all terms from a_k down to some a_{k - m +1} } are ≥ a_{k - m +1} } ≥ ... ≥ a_k &gt; T/2. But this would imply there&#39;s only one term (a_k) greater than T/2. Otherwise, if a_{k-1} ≥ a_k &gt; T/2, then a_{k-1} + a_k &gt; T, but the sum of all k terms is less than T, which is impossible.Therefore, a_k must be the only term greater than T/2 in the first k terms. Hence, the first k-1 terms are ≤ T/2, and their sum is (sum of first k terms) - a_k &lt; T - a_k. But a_k &gt; T/2, so T - a_k &lt; T/2. Therefore, the sum of the first k-1 terms is less than T/2.But then the first k-1 terms are all ≤ T/2, and their sum is less than T/2. Therefore, even if we add a_k (which is ≤ a_{k+1} ≤ 2a_k), but this line of reasoning is getting convoluted.Maybe another approach: Assume for contradiction that there exists a sequence meeting the criteria with even sum that cannot be partitioned. Take the minimal such sequence (in terms of n). Then analyze its properties.Suppose such a minimal counterexample exists. Let n be minimal. Then for all sequences of length &lt;n with even sum and the given growth conditions, they can be partitioned. Now look at the sequence of length n.If a_n ≤ S/2, then include a_n in the subset and check if the remaining terms can sum to S/2 - a_n. By induction, since the remaining sum is (S - a_n) which is S/2 + (S/2 - a_n). Wait, not sure.Alternatively, if we remove a_n, the remaining sum is S - a_n. If we can find a subset in the first n-1 terms that sums to S/2 - a_n, then adding a_n gives the desired subset. If not, then we need to find a subset in the first n-1 terms that sums to S/2. If neither is possible, then we have a counterexample.But by minimality of n, the first n-1 terms must not be able to be partitioned into S/2 or S/2 - a_n. But this seems difficult to maintain given the constraints.Alternatively, think in terms of linear algebra. The problem is equivalent to solving the equation x1*a1 + x2*a2 + ... + xn*an = S/2 where xi ∈ {0,1}. This is a subset sum problem. The question is whether such a solution exists given the constraints on the ai.There&#39;s a theorem called the Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem which states that any 2n-1 integers have a subset of n integers whose sum is divisible by n. But this isn&#39;t directly applicable here.Another theorem: If the numbers are all within a factor of 2 of each other, then the partition is possible. But I&#39;m not sure.Wait, the problem&#39;s conditions imply that each number is at least the previous and at most double the previous. So starting from 1, the sequence can grow but not too rapidly. This might imply that the numbers are all within a factor of 2^{n-1} of each other, but that&#39;s too vague.Perhaps another angle: Since each term is at most double the previous, the total sum S is at most 2^{n} -1 (as a geometric series). But since the sum is even, S is at least 2 (for n=2) and up.But this doesn&#39;t directly help.Wait, let&#39;s think recursively again. Suppose we have the sequence a1=1, a2,..., an with sum 2T. If we can show that there&#39;s always a subset summing to T, given the constraints.Assume we&#39;ve proven it up to n-1. Now for n.If a_n = T, then we&#39;re done: take a_n. If a_n &lt; T, then we need to find a subset of the first n-1 terms summing to T - a_n. If a_n &gt; T, then we need to find a subset of the first n-1 terms summing to T.But to use induction, we need to ensure that either T - a_n or T is achievable with the first n-1 terms.But how?If a_n ≤ T, then by the induction hypothesis, if the first n-1 terms have sum S&#39; = 2T - a_n. If S&#39; is even, then we could possibly find a subset summing to (2T - a_n)/2, but we need to find T - a_n.Wait, this is getting tangled. Maybe consider that the conditions on the sequence allow for a dynamic programming approach where we can build up the possible sums.Given the constraints, the numbers don&#39;t grow too quickly, so the subset sum problem might be tractable.But since we need to prove it for all such sequences, not compute it for a specific one, we need a general argument.Another thought: The problem resembles the concept of &quot;totally balanced&quot; sequences or some similar combinatorial structure where equal partition is always possible.Alternatively, consider that the sequence&#39;s growth condition ensures that each new term is not too large relative to the existing sum, so that adding it allows for the necessary flexibility in subset sums.Specifically, since each term a_{i+1} ≤ 2a_i, and the sequence is non-decreasing, the sum up to any point is at least the sum of a geometric series with ratio 1 (since each term is at least the previous), so the sum grows at least linearly. But the upper bound is exponential. However, the key is that each term is not too large compared to the previous sum.Wait, suppose we have a sequence where each term is at most the sum of all previous terms. Then the subset sum problem can be solved by a greedy algorithm. This is the case for the binary representation where each term is the sum of all previous terms plus one (powers of two). But here, the condition is weaker: each term is at most double the previous term. So for example, if we have 1,1,1,...,1, the sum grows linearly, and each term is equal to the previous. If we have 1,2,4,8,..., the sum grows exponentially, and each term is equal to the sum of all previous terms plus one. But in our case, terms can be anywhere in between.But perhaps the key is that even though a term can be as large as double the previous one, the total sum up to that term is at least the sum of the previous terms plus the previous term (since it&#39;s non-decreasing). So S_{i} = S_{i-1} + a_i ≥ S_{i-1} + a_{i-1} ≥ 2S_{i-2} + a_{i-1} (not sure).Alternatively, using induction in the following way: Assume that for any sequence of length k with sum 2T&#39;, there exists a subset summing to T&#39;. Now for a sequence of length k+1 with sum 2T, we need to show there&#39;s a subset summing to T. If the last term a_{k+1} is ≤ T, then we can include it and need to find T - a_{k+1} in the first k terms. The sum of the first k terms is 2T - a_{k+1}. If we can apply the induction hypothesis to the first k terms with target T - a_{k+1}, but the sum of the first k terms is 2T - a_{k+1}, which might not be even. However, T - a_{k+1} is an integer because 2T is even and a_{k+1} is integer. But the sum of the first k terms is 2T - a_{k+1}, which may be odd or even. If it&#39;s even, then by induction hypothesis, we can find a subset summing to (2T - a_{k+1})/2. But we need to find T - a_{k+1}, which is different.This line of reasoning isn&#39;t directly working. Maybe need a different approach.Let’s think about the following strategy: Start with the largest element and subtract it from the target if possible, then proceed recursively. Given the constraints, this might work.Suppose we want to find a subset summing to T. Take the largest element, a_n. If a_n ≤ T, include it and look for T - a_n in the first n-1 elements. If a_n &gt; T, skip it and look for T in the first n-1 elements.To show this works, we need to ensure that if a_n ≤ T, then the remaining target T - a_n can be achieved with the first n-1 elements, given the constraints.But how to guarantee that? Suppose we can prove that the first n-1 elements can form any sum up to their total sum, which is S_{n-1} = S - a_n. But that&#39;s not necessarily true. However, given the constraints, perhaps the first n-1 elements can form any sum up to S_{n-1}, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case.Alternatively, use the fact that a_n ≤ 2a_{n-1} and the sequence is non-decreasing. Thus, a_n ≤ 2a_{n-1} ≤ 2a_{n-1} ≤ ... ≤ 2^{n-1}a1=2^{n-1}. But this exponential growth doesn’t directly help.Wait, another angle: Since the sequence is non-decreasing and each term is at most double the previous, we have a_i ≤ 2^{i-1}. Therefore, the total sum S ≤ 2^{n} -1. But this is similar to a binary number&#39;s bits. However, the sum being even is given. If we think in binary, each term corresponds to a bit, but the sequence doesn&#39;t have to be powers of two.Alternatively, since each term is at most double the previous, the sequence can&#39;t have large gaps that would prevent certain sums from being achieved. For example, if you have 1,2,4,8,..., you can make any sum up to 2^n -1, but in our case, the sequence might not be that sparse.Alternatively, since each term is at least the previous one, the sequence doesn’t decrease, so we don&#39;t have to worry about ordering.Wait, here&#39;s a key insight: The problem&#39;s constraints ensure that the sequence is such that each term is at most the sum of all previous terms plus one. Because a_{i+1} ≤ 2a_i. But a1 + a2 + ... + a_i ≥ a_i + a_i = 2a_i (since each term is at least the previous). So a_{i+1} ≤ sum of previous terms. This is a crucial point.Yes! Let&#39;s verify that:Given that a_{i+1} ≤ 2a_i and the sequence is non-decreasing, then:Sum of the first i terms: S_i = a1 + a2 + ... + a_i.Since the sequence is non-decreasing, S_i ≥ i*a1 = i*1 = i.But also, since a_{i+1} ≤ 2a_i ≤ 2a_i ≤ ... ≤ 2^{i}a1 = 2^{i}.But more importantly, for the sum S_i:We have S_i = a1 + a2 + ... + a_i ≥ a_i + a_i (since each term a1, ..., a_{i-1} ≥1, but a_i ≥ a_{i-1} ≥ ... ≥ a1=1). Wait, not necessarily. For example, if i=2, S_2 = a1 + a2 ≥1 +1=2, and a3 ≤2a2. So S_2 ≥2, and a3 ≤2a2 ≤2*S_2.Wait, let&#39;s think recursively. Assume that for some i ≥1, S_i ≥ a_{i+1}.Wait, not necessarily. For example, take the sequence 1,1,1. Then S_2=2, a3=1 ≤2*1=2. So S_2=2 ≥ a3=1. Similarly, if a3=2, then S_2=2 ≥a3=2.In general, since a_{i+1} ≤2a_i and S_i ≥a_i (since S_i = a1 + ... + a_i ≥a_i). But a_{i+1} ≤2a_i ≤2S_i. Hmm, not directly helpful.Wait, but if we have a_{i+1} ≤2a_i, and S_i ≥a_i + a_{i-1} + ... +a1, which is at least a_i (since other terms are at least 1). So S_i ≥a_i.But a_{i+1} ≤2a_i ≤2S_i. Therefore, a_{i+1} ≤2S_i. However, this doesn&#39;t directly give us a_{i+1} ≤S_i +1 or something like that.Wait, let&#39;s see for the first few terms:a1=1, S1=1a2 ≤2*1=2, S2=1 +a2 ≥2a3 ≤2a2 ≤4, S3= S2 +a3 ≥2 + a3 ≥3But even if a3=4, S3=1+2+4=7, which is greater than a4 ≤2a3=8. So S3=7 &lt;8. So a4=8 is allowed, and S4=7+8=15.But here, a4=8 ≤2a3=8, and S3=7 &lt; a4=8. So in this case, a4 &gt;S3.Wait, this breaks the previous idea that a_{i+1} ≤ sum of previous terms. So that doesn&#39;t hold.But in this case, can we still partition the sequence?Example: 1,2,4,8. Sum is 15, which is odd. Not allowed. If we add another term: 1,2,4,8,16. Sum is 31, odd. Not allowed. If we have 1,2,4,8,16,32. Sum is 63, odd. Seems like powers of two give odd sums. To get an even sum, maybe add a 1 at the end: 1,2,4,8,16,32,1. Sum=64. Target=32. Can we make 32? Yes: 32 itself. So the subset is {32}.Another example: 1,2,4,8,16,31. Sum=62. Target=31. Can we make 31? 16+8+4+2+1=31. Yes.Wait, so even when a term is larger than the sum of all previous terms, as long as the total sum is even, we can still find a subset. In this case, the largest term 31 is larger than the sum of previous terms 1+2+4+8+16=31. So a6=31 = sum of previous terms. Then the sum is 62, and we can take either a6=31 or the previous terms summing to 31.Therefore, even if a term is equal to the sum of all previous terms, the partition is possible. If it&#39;s larger than the sum of all previous terms, then the sum of all previous terms is less than the term, but since the total sum is even, the term must be even? Not necessarily. For example, 1,2,4,8,16,31: 31 is odd, sum is 62 even. However, 31 is less than twice the previous term 16 (32), so allowed. And we can partition by taking the previous terms.This suggests that even if a term is larger than the sum of all previous terms (but ≤ twice the previous term), the partition is still possible because the sum of all previous terms is S_{n-1}, and the total sum S = S_{n-1} + a_n. If S is even, and a_n &gt; S_{n-1}, then S = S_{n-1} + a_n = even. Therefore, S_{n-1} and a_n must have the same parity. If a_n &gt; S_{n-1}, then the target sum S/2 must be equal to a_n - (S_{n-1} - (S/2 - a_n)). Wait, maybe not helpful.But in the example above, when a_n = S_{n-1} +1 (like 31 = 31), and S = 62, then S/2 =31, which is exactly a_n. So you can take a_n. Otherwise, if a_n &lt; S/2, you can include it and find the remainder in the previous terms.The key insight here is that due to the constraints, either the largest term is at most S/2, in which case you can use a greedy approach, or it&#39;s greater than S/2, but then the remaining terms must sum to S/2, which is possible because the largest term is at most twice the previous term, ensuring that the remaining terms can form the required sum.Wait, but in the example where a_n =31 and S_{n-1}=31, we have S/2=31, which is exactly a_n. So we can take a_n. If a_n were greater than S/2, then the remaining sum S_{n-1} = S - a_n &lt; S/2, so we can&#39;t form S/2 from the remaining terms. Therefore, we must include a_n in the subset. But then we need the remaining terms to sum to S/2 - a_n. But S/2 - a_n = (S - 2a_n)/2. Since S=2T, this is (2T - 2a_n)/2 = T - a_n. But since a_n &gt; T, this becomes negative, which is impossible. Therefore, such a case cannot exist, meaning that a_n cannot be greater than S/2.Wait, this is a contradiction. Earlier example had a_n=31 and S=62, so T=31, and a_n=31= T. So a_n ≤ T. Therefore, in cases where a_n &gt; T, the sum S_{n-1} = S - a_n = 2T - a_n &lt; T. But since a_n ≤ 2a_{n-1}, and the sequence is non-decreasing, a_{n-1} ≥ a_{n}/2. Therefore, S_{n-1} ≥ a_{n-1} ≥ a_n/2. So 2T - a_n ≥ a_n/2 ⇒ 2T ≥ (3a_n)/2 ⇒ T ≥ (3a_n)/4. But since a_n &gt; T, this implies T &gt; (3a_n)/4 ⇒ a_n &lt; (4/3)T. But since a_n &gt; T, we have T &lt; a_n &lt; (4/3)T. Therefore, a_n is between T and (4/3)T.Also, since a_n ≤2a_{n-1}, and a_{n-1} ≤a_n (non-decreasing), we have a_{n-1} ≥ a_n/2.But S_{n-1} = 2T - a_n ≥ a_{n-1} ≥ a_n/2.So 2T - a_n ≥ a_n/2 ⇒ 2T ≥ (3a_n)/2 ⇒ T ≥ (3a_n)/4 ⇒ a_n ≤ (4/3)T.But we already have a_n &gt; T, so T &lt; a_n ≤ (4/3)T.Therefore, a_n is in (T, (4/3)T].But S_{n-1} =2T -a_n.Since a_n &gt;T, S_{n-1}=2T -a_n &lt;T.But S_{n-1} = sum of first n-1 terms ≥ (n-1)*1 =n-1.Also, S_{n-1} ≥ a_{n-1} ≥a_n/2 &gt; T/2.So T/2 &lt; S_{n-1} &lt;T.But then, by the induction hypothesis, the first n-1 terms can be partitioned into two subsets with sums S_{n-1}/2 each. But S_{n-1} is not necessarily even. However, the problem states that the total sum S is even. If n is the minimal counterexample, then the first n-1 terms must have sum S_{n-1} =2T -a_n. Since S is even and a_n is integer, S_{n-1} has the same parity as a_n.If S_{n-1} is even, then by induction hypothesis, we can partition the first n-1 terms into two subsets each summing to S_{n-1}/2. Then, adding a_n to one subset would give sums S_{n-1}/2 +a_n and S_{n-1}/2. For these to be equal to T, we need S_{n-1}/2 +a_n =T and S_{n-1}/2 =T -a_n. But S_{n-1}=2T -a_n, so substituting:S_{n-1}/2 = (2T -a_n)/2 =T -a_n/2.We need T -a_n/2 =T -a_n ⇒ a_n/2 =a_n ⇒ a_n=0, which is impossible. Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work.If S_{n-1} is odd, then since S is even, a_n must be odd. But then S_{n-1} =2T -a_n is even minus odd, which is odd. Therefore, the first n-1 terms sum to an odd number. However, the induction hypothesis requires the sum to be even. So in this case, the induction hypothesis doesn&#39;t apply, meaning we cannot use it.This suggests that the induction approach is not straightforward. Perhaps a different method is needed.Let’s consider the following theorem: If every element in the set is at most the sum of all previous elements, then the set can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum if the total sum is even. This is similar to the concept in the classic partition problem where such a condition guarantees a solution.In our problem, the condition is that each element is at most twice the previous one. But does this imply that each element is at most the sum of all previous elements?Not necessarily. For example, in the sequence 1,2,4,8,..., each term is equal to twice the previous term. The sum of previous terms before a_i is S_{i-1}=1+2+4+...+2^{i-2}=2^{i-1}-1. The term a_i=2^{i-1}, which is greater than S_{i-1} when i≥3. For i=3, a_3=4, S_2=3; a_3=4 &gt;3. So the condition a_i ≤2a_{i-1} does not imply a_i ≤ S_{i-1}.However, in such cases, when the term is larger than the sum of all previous terms, the total sum becomes S_i = S_{i-1} +a_i. If the total sum is even, then either a_i is even or the sum of the previous terms is odd. But this doesn&#39;t directly help.But even in such cases, the partition is possible. For example, the sequence 1,2,4,8 sum to 15, which is odd. Not considered. But 1,2,4,8,16 sum to 31, odd. Not considered. If we take 1,2,4,8,16,32, sum is 63, odd. To get an even sum, add another term. For example, 1,2,4,8,16,32,1. Sum=64. Target=32. The subset can be {32} or {16+8+4+2+1+1=32}.Another example where a term exceeds the sum of previous terms: sequence 1,1,2,3,6. Sum is 13, odd. Not considered. Make it 1,1,2,3,6,1. Sum=14. Target=7. Can we make 7? 6+1=7. Yes.Another example: 1,2,3,6. Sum=12. Target=6. 6 itself.So even when a term is larger than the sum of previous terms, if the total sum is even, we can include that term in the subset if it equals the target, or combine it with previous terms.This suggests that the answer is yes, such a partition is always possible.To formalize this, we can use the following inductive argument:We proceed by induction on the number of elements n.Base case: n=2. As discussed, possible only if sum is 2 (1 and 1), which can be partitioned. So base case holds.Inductive step: Assume for all sequences of length k with even sum, the partition exists. Consider a sequence of length k+1 with even sum S=2T.Let a_{k+1} be the largest element. There are two cases:Case 1: a_{k+1} &gt; T.But as shown earlier, this leads to a contradiction because the sum of the first k elements would be less than T, and since a_{k+1} ≤2a_k, the term a_k must be greater than T/2. However, the sum of the first k elements is S - a_{k+1} =2T -a_{k+1}. If a_{k+1} &gt;T, then 2T -a_{k+1} &lt;T. But since a_k ≥a_{k+1}/2 &gt;T/2, and the sequence is non-decreasing, the sum of the first k elements includes a_k and the previous terms. However, if a_k &gt;T/2 and the sequence is non-decreasing, then all terms from a_{k - m +1} to a_k are ≥a_k &gt;T/2. But then the sum of these m terms would be &gt;m*T/2. If m≥2, this sum exceeds T, contradicting the fact that the sum of the first k elements is &lt;T. Hence, there can be at most one term in the first k elements that is &gt;T/2. Therefore, the sum of the first k elements is at most (k-1)*1 + a_k. Since a_k ≤2a_{k-1} and a_{k-1} ≥1, a_k can be up to 2^{k-1}. However, this is not helpful.But perhaps in this case, since a_{k+1} &gt;T and a_{k+1} ≤2a_k, then T &lt;a_{k+1} ≤2a_k ⇒ a_k &gt;T/2. Also, the sum of the first k elements is 2T -a_{k+1}. Since a_{k+1} &gt;T, 2T -a_{k+1} &lt;T. But the sum includes a_k, which is &gt;T/2. Therefore, the sum of the first k elements is a_k + (sum of first k-1 elements) &gt;T/2 + (k-1)*1. Since this sum must be &lt;T, we have T/2 + (k-1) &lt;T ⇒k-1 &lt;T/2. Therefore, k &lt;T/2 +1.But T= S/2= (sum of all k+1 elements)/2. Since each element is at least 1, T ≥(k+1)/2. Therefore, k &lt; ((k+1)/2)/2 +1 ⇒k &lt; (k+1)/4 +1 ⇒ multiply both sides by 4: 4k &lt;k+1 +4 ⇒3k &lt;5 ⇒k &lt;5/3. So k can be 1. But k+1=2, which is the base case. Hence, the only possible case where a_{k+1} &gt;T is when k+1=2, which is handled in the base case. Therefore, for k+1 &gt;2, this case cannot occur. Therefore, the only time a_{k+1} &gt;T is when n=2 and the sum is 2, which is handled. Therefore, for n ≥3, a_{k+1} ≤T.Therefore, for sequences of length n ≥3, the largest element a_n ≤T. Hence, we can apply the greedy approach: include a_n in the subset and solve the subset sum problem for T -a_n in the first n-1 elements.But why is a_n ≤T for n ≥3?Let’s verify this. Suppose n ≥3 and assume for contradiction that a_{n} &gt;T. Then T= S/2 = (sum_{i=1}^n a_i)/2. Since a_{n} &gt;T, then sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i =2T -a_n &lt;T. But a_n ≤2a_{n-1}. Therefore, sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i ≥ (n-1)*1 =n-1. Since sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i &lt;T, then n-1 &lt;T. But T= (sum_{i=1}^n a_i)/2 ≥ (n*1)/2. Therefore, n-1 &lt; (n)/2 ⇒ 2n -2 &lt;n ⇒n &lt;2. But n ≥3, contradiction. Hence, for n ≥3, a_n ≤T.Therefore, for n ≥3, the largest term a_n ≤T, so we can include it in the subset and need to find T -a_n in the first n-1 terms. By the induction hypothesis, since the first n-1 terms have sum S&#39; = sum_{i=1}^{n-1}a_i =2T -a_n. We need to find a subset of the first n-1 terms that sum to T -a_n.But S&#39; =2T -a_n. We need to check if T -a_n is an achievable subset sum. However, T -a_n = (S/2) -a_n = (sum_{i=1}^n a_i)/2 -a_n = (sum_{i=1}^{n-1}a_i -a_n)/2. This is equal to (S&#39; -a_n)/2. But S&#39; =2T -a_n, so T -a_n = (2T -a_n -a_n)/2 = (2T -2a_n)/2 =T -a_n. Which is just restating.However, the key point is that the first n-1 terms have sum S&#39; =2T -a_n, and we need to find a subset of them that sums to T -a_n. Since S&#39; =2T -a_n, then T -a_n = (S&#39; -a_n)/2. So the problem reduces to finding a subset of the first n-1 terms that sums to (S&#39; -a_n)/2. But this is equivalent to partitioning the first n-1 terms into two subsets with sums (S&#39; -a_n)/2 and (S&#39; +a_n)/2. But since the first n-1 terms must satisfy the same conditions (non-decreasing, each term ≤ twice the previous), and their sum is S&#39;, which is even because S&#39; =2T -a_n and S=2T is even, so a_n must have the same parity as S&#39;. Therefore, S&#39; -a_n is even, so (S&#39; -a_n)/2 is an integer.Therefore, by the induction hypothesis, since the first n-1 terms form a valid sequence (non-decreasing, each term ≤ twice the previous) with sum S&#39; =2T -a_n, which is even, we can partition them into two subsets each summing to (S&#39; -a_n)/2 and (S&#39; +a_n)/2. Therefore, the subset summing to (S&#39; -a_n)/2 is exactly what we need to reach T -a_n when combined with a_n. Hence, the induction step holds.Therefore, by induction, for all n ≥2, any sequence of n terms satisfying the conditions with even sum can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sums.Thus, the answer is yes, it is always possible.</p><div class="divider" data-v-a05b535f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a05b535f><span class="icon" data-v-a05b535f>✅:</span>The problem asks whether it&#39;s possible to partition a sequence of integers ( a_1 = 1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) (with ( a_i leq a_{i+1} leq 2a_i ) and an even total sum) into two groups with equal sums.  Key Steps and Analysis:1. Constraints and Base Cases:   - The sequence is non-decreasing, and each term is at most double the previous one.   - For ( n = 2 ), the only valid even sum is ( 2 ) (from ( [1, 1] )), which is trivially partitionable.2. Inductive Approach:   - Inductive Hypothesis: Assume all sequences of length ( k ) with even sums can be partitioned.   - For ( k+1 ) terms, consider the largest term ( a_{k+1} ). If ( a_{k+1} &gt; frac{S}{2} ) (where ( S ) is the total sum), the remaining terms sum to ( S - a_{k+1} &lt; frac{S}{2} ), which is impossible. Thus, ( a_{k+1} leq frac{S}{2} ).3. Greedy Strategy:   - Include ( a_{k+1} ) in one subset and solve for ( frac{S}{2} - a_{k+1} ) in the remaining terms. The remaining terms form a valid sequence (satisfying the same constraints) with an even sum, allowing the inductive hypothesis to apply.4. Critical Insight:   - The sequence&#39;s growth constraints ensure that no term exceeds half the total sum for ( n geq 3 ), enabling the greedy inclusion of the largest term and recursively solving the reduced problem. Conclusion:By induction and leveraging the sequence&#39;s properties, such a partition is always possible when the total sum is even.

Consider the given integers (a_1 = 1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_n) with the conditions:    - (a_i leq a_{i+1} leq 2a_i) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, n-1),    - The sum of all the numbers is even.2. We aim to partition these numbers into two groups such that the sums of the numbers in each group are equal.3. Let&#39;s start by assigning (a_n) to one group and (a_{n-1}) to the other group.4. Subsequently, we will assign each number from (a_{n-2}, a_{n-3}, ldots, a_1) to the group with the smaller sum. If the sums are equal, we can assign to any group.5. Let (Delta_k geq 0) be the difference between the sums of the numbers in the groups after assigning (a_k).6. We need to show that (Delta_k leq a_k).    - Initially, we have:      [      Delta_{n-1} = |a_n - a_{n-1}|      ]      Given the condition (a_{n-1} leq a_n leq 2a_{n-1}), we have:      [      Delta_{n-1} = a_n - a_{n-1} leq 2a_{n-1} - a_{n-1} = a_{n-1}      ]    - Suppose (Delta_k leq a_k). We need to check (Delta_{k-1}):      [      Delta_{k-1} = left| Delta_k - a_{k-1} right|      ]      Using (Delta_k leq a_k) and (a_{k-1} leq a_k leq 2a_{k-1}), it follows that:      [      -a_{k-1} leq Delta_k - a_{k-1} leq a_{k-1}      ]      Thus, (Delta_{k-1} leq a_{k-1}).7. After distributing all numbers into two groups, we will have groups with sums (S_1) and (S_2).    - From the above step, we have ultimately:      [      |Delta_1| = |S_1 - S_2| leq a_1 = 1      ]    - Given the condition that the total sum (S_1 + S_2) is even, if (|S_1 - S_2| leq 1), it forces (S_1) and (S_2) to be equal since the difference must be 0 to maintain an even sum.Conclusion: Since the difference between the sums of the two groups is zero, we conclude that it is possible to partition the integers into two groups with equal sums.(boxed{Yes})</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-9abd4710><span data-v-9abd4710>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.543x.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 Thoughts</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
