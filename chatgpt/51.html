So, the question is about finding the minimum number of different numbers Vasya could have ended up with after repeatedly taking derivatives of a 10th-degree polynomial until reaching a constant. Each time he writes down the nonzero coefficients, including their signs, and constants. The goal is to minimize the number of distinct numbers in all these coefficients across all derivatives.First, I need to understand the process. Let&#39;s start with a 10th-degree polynomial P(x). When we take its derivative, we get a 9th-degree polynomial, then an 8th-degree, and so on, until the 0th degree, which is a constant. Each derivative step reduces the degree by 1. At each step, Vasya writes down the nonzero coefficients. The challenge is to construct such a polynomial where the coefficients (including those from all derivatives) have as few distinct numbers as possible.The key here is that when taking derivatives, each coefficient gets multiplied by its exponent, and then the exponent decreases by 1. So, for example, if the original polynomial has a term a_n x^n, its first derivative will have a term a_n * n x^(n-1), the second derivative will have a_n * n * (n-1) x^(n-2), and so on, until the (n)th derivative, which is a_n * n! (a constant), and then further derivatives will be zero.Therefore, the coefficients in the derivatives are products of the original coefficients and factorial terms. The problem is to arrange the original coefficients such that when multiplied by these factorial terms, the resulting coefficients are as few distinct numbers as possible. Also, note that the coefficients can be positive or negative, but we need to account for their signs as different numbers.Wait, the problem says &quot;different numbers&quot; considering their signs. So, for example, +1 and -1 are considered different. Therefore, we need to not only manage the magnitudes but also the signs to minimize the distinct numbers.So, the strategy is to design a polynomial where the coefficients, when multiplied by the necessary factorial terms (from taking derivatives), result in coefficients that repeat numbers as much as possible, possibly with the same absolute value but different signs. But we need to see if we can have the same number (same sign and magnitude) in different derivatives.Let me start by considering the simplest case: a monomial. If the polynomial is a single term, say a_10 x^10. Then, its derivatives would be 10a_10 x^9, 10*9a_10 x^8, ..., 10! a_10. So, all coefficients here are multiples of a_10 by 10, 10*9, ..., 10! So, these are all distinct unless a_10 is chosen such that some products coincide. However, 10, 10*9, ..., 10! are all different numbers. So even if a_10 is 1, we get coefficients 10, 90, 720, etc., which are all distinct. Therefore, a monomial is bad because the coefficients after derivatives are all different. So, we need a polynomial with multiple terms.The idea is that if different terms in the polynomial, when derived, can produce coefficients that are the same as coefficients from other terms or other derivatives. For example, if two different terms, after appropriate derivatives, result in the same coefficient. Let&#39;s see.Let me consider a polynomial with two terms. Suppose P(x) = a x^10 + b x^k. Let&#39;s pick k such that when taking derivatives, the coefficients from each term might overlap. Let&#39;s see.When we take the first derivative: 10a x^9 + k b x^{k-1}.Second derivative: 90a x^8 + k(k-1) b x^{k-2}....After 10 derivatives, the term a x^10 becomes 10! a, and the term b x^k becomes 0 if k &lt; 10. Wait, but if k is less than 10, then after k derivatives, that term becomes k! b, and then subsequent derivatives eliminate it. So, the constant term from the original polynomial would be a_0, which only appears in P(x) itself. Wait, but the original polynomial is 10th degree, so it&#39;s P(x) = a_10 x^10 + ... + a_1 x + a_0. But in the problem statement, Vasya starts by writing the nonzero coefficients of the original polynomial, then the derivative, etc. So, if the original polynomial has a constant term a_0, then in the first derivative, that term disappears. So, to minimize the number of different numbers, we might want to avoid having too many constants from different derivatives.But let&#39;s think step by step. Let me try to construct a polynomial such that when taking derivatives, the coefficients that appear are as few distinct numbers as possible.Suppose we start with a polynomial where each coefficient is chosen such that after multiplying by the necessary factorial terms (from derivatives), they result in coefficients that are either 1 or -1. But this seems difficult because the factorial terms are large.Alternatively, perhaps we can use coefficients in the original polynomial that are fractions, such that when multiplied by the factorial terms, they become integers. But since coefficients are written as nonzero coefficients with their signs, fractional coefficients would need to be fractions, but the problem says &quot;numbers&quot; which could be fractions, but the question is whether they are considered different. For example, 1/2 and 2 are different numbers. However, the problem says &quot;different numbers&quot;, so if you have fractions, they would count as different numbers. However, since the original polynomial must have integer coefficients? Wait, no, the problem doesn&#39;t state that the coefficients have to be integers. Wait, actually, the problem says &quot;nonzero coefficients&quot; without any restriction, so they can be any real numbers except zero. Therefore, in theory, we could choose coefficients such that when multiplied by factorial terms, they result in the same number.For example, suppose we have a term a x^10. The 10th derivative of this term is 10! a. If we want this to be equal to, say, 1, then a = 1/10!.Similarly, another term b x^9. Its 9th derivative is 9! b. If we set 9! b = 1, then b = 1/9!.But then the coefficients in the original polynomial would be 1/10! and 1/9!, which are different numbers. However, if we can make these coefficients such that when multiplied by their respective factorials, they result in the same number. For example, let&#39;s say we want all the constants obtained after taking derivatives to be 1. Then, for each term x^k, the coefficient should be 1/k!.So, if the original polynomial is P(x) = x^10/10! + x^9/9! + ... + x/1! + 1. Then, each derivative would reduce the terms by one, and the constants at each derivative would be 1. For example, the first derivative would be 10x^9/10! + 9x^8/9! + ... + 1, which simplifies to x^9/9! + x^8/8! + ... + 1. Then, the second derivative would be 9x^8/9! + 8x^7/8! + ... + 0, which simplifies to x^8/8! + x^7/7! + ... + 0. Wait, but the constant term here would be 1 from the first derivative, but actually, after the first derivative, the constant term is 1 (from the original x term). Wait, let&#39;s check this:Original P(x): x^10/10! + x^9/9! + x^8/8! + ... + x + 1.First derivative: 10x^9/10! + 9x^8/9! + 8x^7/8! + ... + 1 + 0.Simplify:10x^9/10! = x^9/9! (since 10/10! = 1/9!)9x^8/9! = x^8/8!Similarly, 8x^7/8! = x^7/7!, etc., down to the derivative of x, which is 1. So the first derivative is x^9/9! + x^8/8! + ... + x + 1.Similarly, the second derivative would be 9x^8/9! + 8x^7/8! + ... + 1 + 0.Which simplifies to x^8/8! + x^7/7! + ... + 1.Continuing this way, each derivative reduces the highest degree term and shifts the others down, with the constant term remaining 1 until the derivative of degree 0, which is the constant 1.Therefore, in this case, all the constants obtained after each derivative are 1. The coefficients of the terms in the derivatives are all 1/(k!) for varying k, but in simplified form, they become 1, right? Wait, no. Let&#39;s see:Wait, for example, the first derivative of x^10/10! is 10x^9/10! = x^9/9!.Similarly, the second derivative is 9x^8/9! = x^8/8!.So, each term, when derived, becomes the term of one degree lower divided by the factorial of that lower degree. So, when we take derivatives, the coefficients are always 1/(k!) for the term x^k. Therefore, in each derivative, the coefficients are 1/(k!) for varying k. However, these are different numbers: 1/9!, 1/8!, etc., which are all distinct. So in this case, the coefficients are all different fractions, which would result in many different numbers. Therefore, this approach isn&#39;t helpful.Alternatively, maybe we can choose coefficients such that after multiplying by the factorial terms, they result in the same number. For example, let&#39;s think of the coefficients in the original polynomial as being reciprocals of factorial numbers so that when multiplied by the factorial in the derivative, they become 1. However, as we saw, this leads to different coefficients in the original polynomial, which are different numbers, but maybe the key is that these different coefficients in the original polynomial are allowed, as long as when taking derivatives, the resulting coefficients are the same.Wait, but the problem says that Vasya writes down the nonzero coefficients of the original polynomial, then the nonzero coefficients of its derivative, and so on. So, all coefficients from all derivatives are written down, and we need to count how many different numbers there are in total.Therefore, if in the original polynomial we have coefficients like 1/10!, 1/9!, ..., 1, then these are all different numbers. Then, in the derivatives, each derivative step would have coefficients 1/9!, 1/8!, ..., 1 (from the first derivative), then 1/8!, ..., 1 (from the second derivative), etc. So, the set of all coefficients would include 1/10!, 1/9!, ..., 1, which are 11 distinct numbers (from 1/10! up to 1). Then, the answer would be 11, but that seems too straightforward. However, the problem asks for the minimal number, so maybe we can do better.Wait, perhaps if we can arrange coefficients such that some coefficients in different derivatives coincide. For example, maybe a coefficient in the original polynomial, when multiplied by some factorial, gives the same number as another coefficient in a derivative. Let&#39;s see.Suppose we have a term a x^10 and another term b x^5. If we take the 5th derivative of a x^10, we get a * 10! / 5! x^5, and the 5th derivative of b x^5 is b * 5! So, if we set a * 10! / 5! = b * 5!, then a * 10! = b * (5!)^2. Then, a = b * (5!)^2 / 10! Let&#39;s compute 10! = 3628800, 5! = 120, so (5!)^2 = 14400. Then, a = b * 14400 / 3628800 = b / 252. So, if we set b = 252, then a = 1. Then, in the 5th derivative, the coefficients of x^5 would be a * 10! / 5! = 1 * 3628800 / 120 = 30240, and b * 5! = 252 * 120 = 30240. So, these coefficients are equal. Therefore, in the 5th derivative, the coefficient of x^5 is 30240, which is the same from both terms. However, in the original polynomial, we have coefficients a=1 and b=252, which are different. Then, in the derivatives, we might have more coefficients. Wait, but the original polynomial has coefficients 1 and 252. Then, the first derivative would have coefficients 10*1 = 10 (from x^10) and 5*252 = 1260 (from x^5). The second derivative would have 10*9 = 90 and 5*4*252 = 5040. Wait, but in the fifth derivative, as we saw, we have 30240 from both terms. However, the coefficients in the original polynomial are 1 and 252, which are different. Then, in the derivatives, we have coefficients like 10, 90, ..., 30240, and 1260, 5040, etc. So, this seems to introduce more distinct numbers.Alternatively, maybe by overlapping coefficients in different derivatives. For example, suppose that a coefficient in the original polynomial becomes, after some derivative, equal to a coefficient from another term in a different derivative. Let me think.Suppose we have two terms in the polynomial: one term is x^10, and another term is x^5. Let&#39;s see:Original polynomial coefficients: 1 (from x^10), 1 (from x^5).First derivative: 10x^9, 5x^4. Coefficients: 10, 5.Second derivative: 90x^8, 20x^3. Coefficients: 90, 20.Third derivative: 720x^7, 60x^2. Coefficients: 720, 60.Fourth derivative: 5040x^6, 120x. Coefficients: 5040, 120.Fifth derivative: 30240x^5, 120 (constant). Coefficients: 30240, 120.Sixth derivative: 151200x^4. Coefficients: 151200.And so on, until the 10th derivative: 10! = 3628800 (constant). Coefficients: 3628800.So, all these coefficients are distinct. Therefore, even if we have two terms with coefficient 1, the derivatives produce many different coefficients. So, this approach also leads to many distinct numbers.Wait, maybe we can choose coefficients such that the products from the derivatives result in coefficients that are the same as in other derivatives. For example, if a coefficient in the second derivative is equal to a coefficient in the original polynomial. Let&#39;s try.Suppose we have P(x) = a x^10 + b x^2. Let&#39;s see:Original coefficients: a, b.First derivative: 10a x^9 + 2b x. Coefficients: 10a, 2b.Second derivative: 90a x^8 + 2b. Coefficients: 90a, 2b.Third derivative: 720a x^7. Coefficients: 720a....Tenth derivative: 10! a. Coefficients: 10! a.Now, suppose we want 2b = a. Then, in the original polynomial, a and b = a/2. But unless a is 0, which it can&#39;t be, these are different coefficients. However, if we set 2b = 10a (from first derivative coefficient 10a and 2b). Let&#39;s set 10a = 2b =&gt; b = 5a. Then, original coefficients are a and 5a. Then, second derivative coefficients: 90a and 2b = 10a. So 90a and 10a. Still different. Then, third derivative: 720a. So, different again.Alternatively, set 90a = 2b. Then, b = 45a. Then original coefficients a and 45a. First derivative coefficients: 10a and 2b = 90a. Then second derivative coefficients: 90a and 2b = 90a (since second derivative of x^2 is 2, so 2b). Wait, no: second derivative of x^2 is 2, so the coefficient is 2b. But in the second derivative, the term from x^10 is 90a x^8 and the term from x^2 is 2b. So coefficients are 90a and 2b. If we set 90a = 2b, then b = 45a. Then original coefficients are a and 45a. First derivative coefficients: 10a and 2b = 90a. So, 10a and 90a. Second derivative coefficients: 90a and 2b = 90a. So, here, in the second derivative, we have two coefficients: 90a and 90a (since 2b = 90a). Therefore, in the second derivative, both coefficients are 90a, so Vasya writes down 90a once. Wait, but the problem says &quot;nonzero coefficients&quot;, so if two terms have the same coefficient, he still writes it once? Wait, no. The problem states: &quot;the nonzero coefficients of the resulting polynomial&quot;. So, if the polynomial is, say, 90a x^8 + 90a, then the coefficients are 90a and 90a. But coefficients are written down with their signs. If they are the same number, he writes them down once. Wait, the problem says &quot;different numbers he could have ended up with&quot;. So if the same number appears multiple times, it&#39;s only counted once. Therefore, if in the second derivative, we have two instances of 90a, then 90a is counted once.So in this case, original coefficients: a, 45a. First derivative coefficients: 10a, 90a. Second derivative coefficients: 90a (from x^8 term) and 90a (from the constant term). So, Vasya writes down 90a once. Then, third derivative: 720a x^7. Coefficient: 720a. Fourth derivative: 5040a x^6. Etc., until the 10th derivative: 10! a.So, the numbers written down are:Original: a, 45a.First derivative: 10a, 90a.Second derivative: 90a, 90a → just 90a.Third derivative: 720a.Fourth: 5040a....Tenth derivative: 10! a.So, the distinct numbers here are a, 45a, 10a, 90a, 720a, 5040a, ..., 10! a. So, still a lot, but maybe if we set a such that some of these numbers coincide.For example, if we set a = 1, then the numbers are 1, 45, 10, 90, 720, ..., 3628800. All different.If we set a = 1/90, then numbers are 1/90, 45*(1/90)=0.5, 10*(1/90)=1/9, 90*(1/90)=1, 720*(1/90)=8, etc. So, 1/90, 0.5, 1/9, 1, 8, ..., which are all different.Alternatively, set a such that 10a = 90a ⇒ 10a = 90a ⇒ 80a = 0 ⇒ a = 0, which is invalid.Alternatively, set 10a = a ⇒ 9a = 0 ⇒ a=0, invalid.Alternatively, set 45a = 10a ⇒ 35a = 0 ⇒ a=0, invalid.Hmm, so perhaps this approach isn&#39;t helpful. Maybe another approach is needed.Another idea is to have the polynomial be symmetric in some way, such that coefficients in different derivatives overlap. For example, a polynomial where all even derivatives have the same coefficients as some previous polynomial, but this might not help.Wait, let&#39;s think about the number of distinct coefficients required. The original polynomial is degree 10. Each derivative reduces the degree by 1. So, we have 11 polynomials (original, 1st derivative, ..., 10th derivative). Each of these polynomials has coefficients. The constants in each derivative will be the (n)th derivative evaluated at 0, which is n! times the original coefficient of x^n.Wait, if we have a term a_n x^n in the original polynomial, then in the k-th derivative, the coefficient of x^{n - k} is a_n * (n)_k, where (n)_k is the falling factorial: n(n-1)...(n - k + 1). The constant term in the k-th derivative is a_k * k! (if k &lt;= original degree). Wait, no: the constant term of the k-th derivative is the coefficient of x^k in the original polynomial multiplied by k!.Wait, more precisely, the k-th derivative of P(x) is the sum_{n=k}^{10} a_n * n! / (n - k)! x^{n - k}. Therefore, the constant term (x^0 term) in the k-th derivative is a_k * k!.Therefore, each constant term in the k-th derivative is a_k * k!.So, if we want all these constants to be the same number, say 1, then we can set a_k = 1 / k! for each k from 0 to 10. But then, the original polynomial would have coefficients 1/10!, 1/9!, ..., 1/1!, 1. These are all distinct numbers, so Vasya would write down 11 different numbers just from the original polynomial. Then, in the derivatives, the constants would all be 1, which is already counted. However, the non-constant terms in the derivatives would have coefficients like 1/(9!), 1/(8!), etc., which are already in the original coefficients. Wait, no: in the first derivative, the coefficients are 1/9!, 1/8!, ..., 1, which are same as the coefficients of the original polynomial except for the highest degree term. So, in the first derivative, the coefficients are 1/9!, ..., 1. Then, the second derivative has coefficients 1/8!, ..., 1. Therefore, all these coefficients are already present in the original polynomial. Therefore, the total distinct numbers would be 1/10!, 1/9!, ..., 1, which is 11 distinct numbers. However, if we consider that in each derivative, the coefficients are the same as in the original polynomial but shifted, then all the numbers are already accounted for in the original polynomial. Therefore, the total distinct numbers would be 11. But the problem says &quot;nonzero coefficients... recorded with their signs&quot;, and &quot;different numbers&quot;. So, if 1/10! is positive, then all coefficients are positive, so no sign issues. Therefore, 11 distinct numbers. But can we do better?Wait, maybe if we have overlapping coefficients. For example, if some coefficients in different derivatives are equal to each other or to coefficients in the original polynomial. For example, in the previous example where all constants are 1, but the original coefficients are reciprocals of factorials. However, this gives 11 distinct numbers. Maybe we can find a polynomial where some coefficients in derivatives coincide with original coefficients.Alternatively, suppose we take a polynomial where all coefficients are 1 or -1. Then, when taking derivatives, the coefficients get multiplied by factorial terms, which may result in larger numbers, but maybe if arranged properly, some products could be 1 or -1. However, this seems difficult because multiplying by factorial terms (which are greater than 1) would result in larger numbers. Unless we use fractions, but coefficients need to be non-zero, but the problem doesn&#39;t restrict coefficients to integers.Wait, but if we use coefficients that are 1/n! for the original polynomial, then derivatives would produce coefficients that are 1/(n-1)!, etc., which are different numbers. So, that gives 11 distinct numbers as above. However, the problem is asking for the minimal number. If 11 is possible, but can we get fewer?Wait, let&#39;s think differently. Suppose we design the polynomial such that all non-zero coefficients in all derivatives are either 1 or -1. Is that possible?To have derivatives produce coefficients that are 1 or -1, the original coefficients must be fractions such that when multiplied by the factorial terms, they result in ±1. For example, a term a_n x^n must satisfy a_n * n! = ±1, so a_n = ±1/n!.Similarly, the next term a_{n-1} x^{n-1} would need a_{n-1} * (n-1)! = ±1, so a_{n-1} = ±1/(n-1)!.But if we do this, then the original coefficients would be ±1/10!, ±1/9!, ..., ±1, which are all distinct unless some of them coincide. However, 1/10! is different from 1/9!, etc. So, even with signs, if we alternate signs, the numbers would still be distinct. For example, -1/10! is different from 1/10! and different from -1/9!, etc. Therefore, this approach would still result in 11 distinct numbers. So maybe 11 is the minimum?But the problem says &quot;the minimum number of different numbers he could have ended up with&quot;. Wait, but in the example where all constants are 1, the original polynomial has coefficients 1/10!, 1/9!, ..., 1. So, those are 11 distinct numbers. However, in the derivatives, the coefficients are 1/9!, 1/8!, ..., 1 (from the first derivative), which are already included in the original set. Similarly, the second derivative&#39;s coefficients are 1/8!, ..., 1, which are already in the original set. Therefore, the total distinct numbers are just 11. Therefore, the answer might be 11. But is there a way to make fewer?Wait, maybe if some coefficients in different derivatives coincide with each other or with original coefficients. For example, maybe a coefficient in the original polynomial is equal to a coefficient in a derivative. Let&#39;s see.Suppose the original polynomial has a coefficient a, and in some derivative, there is a coefficient b such that a = b. For example, if a term in the original polynomial is a x^10, then the 10th derivative is 10! a. If we set 10! a = a, then 10! a = a ⇒ a(10! - 1) = 0 ⇒ a = 0, which is invalid. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe a coefficient from the first derivative equals a coefficient from the original polynomial. For example, the first derivative of a x^10 is 10 a x^9. If we set 10 a = a, then 9a = 0 ⇒ a=0, invalid.Alternatively, set 10 a = b, where b is another coefficient in the original polynomial. Suppose P(x) = a x^10 + b x^9. Then, first derivative is 10a x^9 + 9b x^8. If we set 10a = b and 9b = a. Then:From 10a = b and 9b = a.Substitute b = 10a into the second equation: 9*(10a) = a ⇒ 90a = a ⇒ 89a = 0 ⇒ a = 0. Invalid.Alternatively, set 10a = 9b. Then b = (10/9)a. Then, original coefficients are a and (10/9)a. First derivative coefficients are 10a and 9b = 10a. So, in the first derivative, coefficients are 10a and 10a. So Vasya writes down 10a once. Then, second derivative would be 90a x^8 + 72b x^7 = 90a x^8 + 72*(10/9)a x^7 = 90a x^8 + 80a x^7. Coefficients 90a and 80a. Different. Then, third derivative: 720a x^7 + 560a x^6. Coefficients 720a and 560a. Still different. So, even with this setup, we end up with multiple distinct numbers.But perhaps if we make a chain where each coefficient in a derivative is equal to the next coefficient. For example, original coefficients a, b, c... such that 10a = b, 9b = c, 8c = d, etc. Let&#39;s see:Let’s suppose the original polynomial has terms a x^10 + b x^9 + c x^8 + ... + j x + k.We want the coefficients of the derivatives to be equal to subsequent coefficients.First derivative: 10a x^9 + 9b x^8 + 8c x^7 + ... + j.If we set 10a = b, 9b = c, 8c = d, ..., 1*j = k.Then, we can express all coefficients in terms of a:b = 10ac = 9b = 90ad = 8c = 720ae = 7d = 5040af = 6e = 30240ag = 5f = 151200ah = 4g = 604800ai = 3h = 1814400aj = 2i = 3628800ak = 1*j = 3628800aTherefore, the original polynomial coefficients are:a, 10a, 90a, 720a, 5040a, 30240a, 151200a, 604800a, 1814400a, 3628800a, 3628800a.So, if we choose a = 1, then the coefficients are:1, 10, 90, 720, 5040, 30240, 151200, 604800, 1814400, 3628800, 3628800.These are all distinct except for the last two coefficients (of x and the constant term), which are both 3628800a. Therefore, in the original polynomial, Vasya writes down 10 different numbers (since the last two are the same). Then, the first derivative would have coefficients:10a, 9b = 90a, 8c = 720a, ..., 1*j = 3628800a.But since b = 10a, c = 90a, etc., the first derivative coefficients are:10a, 90a, 720a, ..., 3628800a.Which are the same as the original polynomial coefficients from the second term onwards. Therefore, the first derivative introduces no new numbers. Similarly, the second derivative coefficients would be 90a, 720a, ..., 3628800a, which are already in the original polynomial. This continues until the 10th derivative, which is 3628800a.Therefore, the total distinct numbers are the original coefficients: 1, 10, 90, 720, 5040, 30240, 151200, 604800, 1814400, 3628800 (since the last two coefficients in the original polynomial are both 3628800a, so counted once). So, 10 distinct numbers from the original polynomial. However, the first derivative doesn&#39;t add any new numbers, same with the other derivatives. Wait, but the 10th derivative is 3628800a, which is already counted. So, in this setup, Vasya writes down the coefficients:Original: 1, 10, 90, 720, 5040, 30240, 151200, 604800, 1814400, 3628800.First derivative: 10, 90, 720, 5040, 30240, 151200, 604800, 1814400, 3628800.Second derivative: 90, 720, 5040, ..., 3628800.And so on, until the 10th derivative: 3628800.So, all numbers are already in the original polynomial. Therefore, total distinct numbers are 10. But wait, in the original polynomial, we have 11 coefficients (from x^10 to x^0). But in our setup above, the coefficients for x and the constant term are both 3628800a. Therefore, the original polynomial has 10 distinct coefficients. Then, all derivatives have coefficients that are subsets of these 10 numbers. Therefore, the total distinct numbers are 10. But wait, let&#39;s check:Original polynomial coefficients: a=1, 10a=10, 90a=90, 720a=720, 5040a=5040, 30240a=30240, 151200a=151200, 604800a=604800, 1814400a=1814400, 3628800a=3628800 (for both x and constant term). So, total of 10 distinct numbers.First derivative coefficients: 10, 90, 720, ..., 3628800. These are all already in the original set.Similarly, all subsequent derivatives only have coefficients from the original set. Therefore, Vasya ends up with only 10 distinct numbers. Therefore, the minimal number is 10?But wait, in the original polynomial, the coefficient of x and the constant term are both 3628800a. So if a=1, they are both 3628800. Therefore, Vasya writes down 3628800 once for the original polynomial. Then, the first derivative has coefficients from 10 up to 3628800, which are already included. Therefore, total distinct numbers are 10. So, is 10 the answer?But let me confirm with an example. Let&#39;s take a smaller case, say a quadratic polynomial, to see if this works.Suppose we have P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.Let’s set it up such that derivatives have coefficients that are already present.First derivative: 2a x + b.Second derivative: 2a.Original coefficients: a, b, c.If we set 2a = b and b = 2a, and then 2a (from the second derivative) = c. So:From 2a = b and 2a = c.Therefore, b = c = 2a.Original coefficients: a, 2a, 2a.First derivative coefficients: 2a, 2a.Second derivative: 2a.So, Vasya writes down in original: a, 2a.First derivative: 2a.Second derivative: 2a.Total distinct numbers: a and 2a. If a is chosen as 1, then numbers are 1 and 2. If a is chosen as something else, say 1/2, then numbers are 0.5 and 1. Still two distinct numbers. Therefore, in the quadratic case, the minimal number is 2.Which is fewer than the number of original coefficients (3), because two coefficients were the same. So, in the case of the 10th-degree polynomial, if we can set multiple coefficients to be the same number, then the total distinct numbers can be reduced. In the previous setup, we had two coefficients (x term and constant term) being the same, reducing the count by 1. However, in that case, we also had all derivatives&#39; coefficients already present in the original polynomial. Therefore, leading to 10 distinct numbers. Therefore, perhaps 10 is the answer.But wait, wait. Let&#39;s see. The 10th-degree polynomial constructed as per the chain above has coefficients:1, 10, 90, 720, 5040, 30240, 151200, 604800, 1814400, 3628800 (with the last two terms both 3628800). So, 10 distinct numbers.All derivatives only have coefficients that are already in this list. Therefore, Vasya writes down these 10 numbers. So, the answer is 10.But is there a way to make it even fewer?Suppose we can have more overlapping coefficients. For example, in the original polynomial, maybe more coefficients can be equal. Let&#39;s see.For example, in the previous setup, the coefficients are 1, 10, 90, 720, ..., 3628800. Suppose we can set two of these to be the same by choosing a different a. For example, if we set a = 1/10, then the coefficients become 0.1, 1, 9, 72, 504, 3024, 15120, 60480, 181440, 362880. These are still all distinct. If we set a = 1/90, then coefficients are 1/90, 1/9, 1, 8, 56, 336, 1680, 6720, 20160, 40320. Still distinct. So, changing a scales all coefficients but keeps their ratios the same, hence they remain distinct. Therefore, unless a=0, which is invalid, we can&#39;t make any of them equal.Therefore, in this construction, we can&#39;t reduce the number of distinct coefficients below 10. But is there a smarter construction?Another idea: maybe use negative coefficients to reuse numbers via sign. For example, if in some derivative, a coefficient is -a, where a was already used. Then, since signs are considered different, but if we can have a coefficient and its negative both appear, but perhaps by combining terms cleverly, we can have fewer distinct magnitudes, hence fewer distinct numbers when considering absolute values. But the problem counts numbers with their signs, so +1 and -1 are different. However, maybe if we can have coefficients that are negatives of each other, but in such a way that their products with factorial terms give numbers that have already been seen with the opposite sign.For example, suppose in the original polynomial, we have a coefficient +1 and a coefficient -1. Then, in a derivative, a coefficient might become -10, which could be a new number, unless there is another term that cancels it to give a coefficient that is already present.Wait, this is getting complicated. Let&#39;s try an example. Suppose we have P(x) = x^10 - x^9. Then, the first derivative is 10x^9 - 9x^8. Coefficients: 10, -9. Second derivative: 90x^8 - 72x^7. Coefficients: 90, -72. Third derivative: 720x^7 - 504x^6. Coefficients: 720, -504. And so on. Each derivative introduces new coefficients with alternating signs. This would double the number of distinct numbers, so probably not helpful.Alternatively, maybe design a polynomial where the coefficients are set such that when taking derivatives, some positive and negative coefficients cancel out or result in existing numbers. For example, consider P(x) = x^10 + x^9 - x^9 = x^10. Then, this reduces to a monomial, which we already saw is bad. So, cancellation in the original polynomial is not helpful.Alternatively, use higher-degree terms to cancel lower-degree terms&#39; coefficients in derivatives. For example, suppose P(x) = a x^10 + b x^9 + c x^8. If we choose a, b, c such that in the first derivative, 10a x^9 + 9b x^8 + 8c x^7 has coefficients that match the original polynomial&#39;s coefficients or their negatives.But this seems tricky. Let&#39;s try:Suppose we want 10a = a&#39;, 9b = b&#39;, 8c = c&#39;, etc., but I don&#39;t see an immediate way to make this cycle.Alternatively, set up a system where coefficients in derivatives are equal to coefficients in the original polynomial. For example:Let’s try to make a polynomial where the coefficients in the first derivative are the same as in the original polynomial. For example:Original polynomial: P(x) = a x^10 + b x^9 + c x^8 + ... + j x + k.First derivative: P’(x) = 10a x^9 + 9b x^8 + 8c x^7 + ... + j.We want P’(x) to have the same coefficients as P(x), but shifted. So, 10a = b, 9b = c, 8c = d, ..., 2i = j, j = k.Wait, this is similar to the earlier chain. If we set 10a = b, 9b = c, 8c = d, ..., then we get the same coefficients as before. However, in this case, the first derivative&#39;s coefficients are b, c, d, ..., k. So, if we set 10a = b, 9b = c, etc., then the first derivative&#39;s coefficients would be 10a, 9b=90a, 8c=720a, etc., which are the same as the original polynomial&#39;s coefficients from the second term onwards. Therefore, this would not result in fewer distinct numbers.Alternatively, if we set P’(x) = P(x). For this to be possible, the derivative of P(x) must equal P(x). The only non-zero polynomial satisfying this is of the form P(x) = Ce^x, but since we&#39;re dealing with polynomials, the only solution is the zero polynomial, which is invalid. So, this is impossible.Another angle: consider the number of distinct numbers required. Each derivative step from a degree n polynomial to a constant involves n+1 polynomials. For a 10th-degree polynomial, that&#39;s 11 polynomials. Each can contribute new coefficients. To minimize the total distinct numbers, we need to maximize the overlap between coefficients across different derivatives.In the earlier example where all constants are 1, and the polynomial is the sum_{k=0}^{10} x^k /k!, the coefficients are 1/10!, 1/9!, ..., 1. These are 11 distinct numbers. But if we can find a polynomial where some coefficients in different derivatives coincide, even with different signs, we can reduce the total count.Wait, but signs matter. So, if we have +a and -a, they count as two different numbers. However, if we can have a term that generates +a in one derivative and another term that generates -a in another derivative, and there&#39;s no overlap where they would cancel, then we would have two distinct numbers. But if they cancel in some derivative, then they don&#39;t contribute. However, cancellation would require the coefficients to add to zero, but that would mean one of them is the negative of the other, so they are distinct.Alternatively, maybe use the same number with different signs in different places. For example, if in the original polynomial, we have +1 and -1 as coefficients, and in derivatives, we also get +1 and -1. However, the derivatives involve multiplication by factorial terms, which are positive, so the signs would be preserved or flipped based on the original coefficients. For example, if we have -x^10, its derivatives would have negative coefficients multiplied by positive factorials, so resulting in negative numbers. If we also have positive coefficients in other terms, we could have both positive and negative numbers, but this would increase the distinct count unless managed carefully.Wait, for example, suppose we have P(x) = x^10 - x^5. Then, the first derivative is 10x^9 -5x^4. Second derivative is 90x^8 -20x^3. Third derivative is 720x^7 -60x^2. Fourth derivative is 5040x^6 -120x. Fifth derivative is 30240x^5 -120. Sixth derivative is 151200x^4. Seventh derivative is 604800x^3. Eighth derivative is 1814400x^2. Ninth derivative is 3628800x. Tenth derivative is 3628800.The coefficients here are: 1, -1, 10, -5, 90, -20, 720, -60, 5040, -120, 30240, -120, 151200, 604800, 1814400, 3628800, 3628800. This results in many distinct numbers, more than 10.Alternatively, if we set up a polynomial where coefficients are arranged such that positive and negative coefficients result in the same absolute value after derivatives. For example, if a term a x^n becomes a*n! in the nth derivative, and another term -a x^m becomes -a*m! in the mth derivative. If n! = m!, then these would be a*n! and -a*n! which are different numbers. But n! = m! implies n = m, so not helpful.Alternatively, use terms where a*n! = b*m! with different n and m. For example, choose a and b such that a*10! = b*7!. Then, b = a*10!/7! = a*720. So, if we have a term a x^10 and b x^7, with b = 720a, then in the 10th derivative, we get a*10! and in the 7th derivative, we get b*7! = 720a*7! = a*720*7! = a*10! (since 10! = 10*9*8*7! = 720*7!). Therefore, a*10! and b*7! are the same. Therefore, if we set the coefficients such that a*10! = c and b*7! = c, then both would contribute c to their respective derivatives. However, in this case, a*10! = b*7! = c, so if we choose c = 1, then a = 1/10! and b = 1/7! = 720/10! = 1/(7!)=1/5040. But then a and b are different coefficients, so in the original polynomial, we have 1/10! and 1/5040, which are different numbers. Then, in the 10th derivative, we have 1, and in the 7th derivative, we have 1. So, the number 1 appears in two different derivatives. But the original coefficients are 1/10! and 1/5040, which are distinct, and the other coefficients would also need to be considered.Wait, if we construct the polynomial as the sum_{k=0}^{10} (-1)^k /k! x^k. Then, the derivatives would involve coefficients that alternate in sign but are still 1/(k-1)!, etc. However, this would introduce both positive and negative versions of the fractions, thereby doubling the number of distinct numbers compared to the all-positive case. So, this is worse.Alternatively, think about the polynomial P(x) = (x - 1)^10. This polynomial has binomial coefficients which are alternating in sign. The expansion is Σ_{k=0}^{10} C(10, k) (-1)^{10 - k} x^k. The coefficients are C(10, k) (-1)^{10 - k}. These are all distinct in magnitude and sign. Then, taking derivatives would produce coefficients that are products of these binomial coefficients and factorial terms, leading to even more distinct numbers. So, not helpful.Another approach: consider that the minimal number of distinct coefficients is achieved when all non-zero coefficients in all derivatives are the same number or its negative. For example, all coefficients are 1 or -1. But as discussed earlier, this requires the original coefficients to be 1/n! or -1/n!, leading to many distinct numbers.Alternatively, perhaps use a polynomial where each derivative is a multiple of the previous one. For example, P(x) = e^{kx}, but this is not a polynomial. However, for polynomials, this is only possible if P(x) is a monomial, which we already saw is bad.Wait, perhaps if the polynomial is designed such that each derivative is a scalar multiple of the original polynomial. For example, if P&#39;(x) = k P(x). The solution to this differential equation is P(x) = Ce^{kx}, which is not a polynomial unless k=0, which makes P(x) constant. Therefore, not helpful.Alternatively, maybe use a polynomial that is a perfect power, like (x + a)^n. The coefficients here are binomial coefficients, which are all distinct for different terms. So, this would not help.Given all these attempts, it seems that the earlier approach where the polynomial is constructed such that all constants in the derivatives are the same number, and the other coefficients are scaled versions leading to 10 distinct numbers, might be the minimal. However, in that case, the total distinct numbers are 10. But I need to verify if this is indeed achievable.Wait, in the chain setup where each coefficient is a multiple of the previous one by the next integer, leading to coefficients 1, 10, 90, 720, ..., 3628800 (10 distinct numbers), and all derivatives only have coefficients from this set. Therefore, Vasya writes down these 10 numbers. So, this seems to be the minimal.But wait, let&#39;s confirm with an explicit example.Let’s take P(x) = x^10 + 10x^9 + 90x^8 + 720x^7 + 5040x^6 + 30240x^5 + 151200x^4 + 604800x^3 + 1814400x^2 + 3628800x + 3628800.This polynomial has coefficients:1 (x^10),10 (x^9),90 (x^8),720 (x^7),5040 (x^6),30240 (x^5),151200 (x^4),604800 (x^3),1814400 (x^2),3628800 (x),3628800 (constant).So, the last two coefficients (x and constant) are both 3628800. Therefore, Vasya writes down 10 distinct numbers in the original polynomial: 1, 10, 90, 720, 5040, 30240, 151200, 604800, 1814400, 3628800.First derivative:10x^9 + 90x^8 + 720x^7 + 5040x^6 + 30240x^5 + 151200x^4 + 604800x^3 + 1814400x^2 + 3628800x + 3628800.Coefficients: 10, 90, 720, 5040, 30240, 151200, 604800, 1814400, 3628800, 3628800. All these are already in the original set.Second derivative:90x^8 + 720x^7 + 5040x^6 + 30240x^5 + 151200x^4 + 604800x^3 + 1814400x^2 + 3628800x + 0.Coefficients: 90, 720, 5040, 30240, 151200, 604800, 1814400, 3628800. All in the original set.Continuing this way, each derivative drops the lowest degree term and has coefficients already present in the original set. The 10th derivative is 3628800, which is already in the original set.Therefore, Vasya writes down only 10 distinct numbers. Therefore, the minimum number is 10.But wait, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a polynomial with fewer distinct numbers. For example, could we construct a polynomial where more coefficients coincide?Suppose we set up a polynomial where two different terms, after multiplying by their respective factorial terms, result in the same coefficient in different derivatives.For example, suppose we have a term a x^10 and a term b x^5. The 10th derivative of a x^10 is 10! a, and the 5th derivative of b x^5 is 5! b. If we set 10! a = 5! b, then b = 10! /5! a = 30240 a. Then, in the 10th derivative, we have 10! a, and in the 5th derivative, we have 5! b = 5! * 30240 a = 3628800 a. Now, if we set a such that 10! a is equal to another coefficient in some derivative.But this seems to complicate things. Suppose we want 10! a = 3628800 a. This implies a =0, which is invalid. Otherwise, if we set 10! a = another coefficient, say 3628800 a, which would require 10! = 3628800, which is true (10! = 3628800), so 10! a = 3628800 a, which is always true. Therefore, if we have both terms a x^10 and b x^5 with b = 30240 a, then the 10th derivative is 3628800 a, and the 5th derivative is 3628800 a. So, in both the 5th and 10th derivatives, the constant term is 3628800 a. However, in the original polynomial, we have a and b = 30240 a, which are different coefficients. So, this adds two distinct numbers: a and 30240 a. Unless a is set to 0, which is invalid.Therefore, this approach introduces more distinct numbers.Another idea: use multiple terms that contribute to the same coefficient in different derivatives. For example, suppose a x^10 and b x^9 are chosen such that their derivatives produce the same coefficient in different places.But this would require that 10a = 9b, 90a = 8b, etc., which would lead to a = 0, as earlier.Alternatively, use a polynomial with terms that, when derived, their coefficients overlap in a way that multiple derivatives share coefficients. For example, if we have terms in the original polynomial that, after different numbers of derivatives, produce the same coefficient. For instance, a x^n and b x^m such that n! a = m! b. Then, in the n-th derivative, the term a x^n becomes n! a, and in the m-th derivative, the term b x^m becomes m! b = n! a. So, both derivatives have the same coefficient n! a. Therefore, this number appears in two different derivatives.If we can set up multiple such terms, we might reduce the total distinct numbers.For example, let&#39;s consider a polynomial with three terms: a x^10, b x^6, c x^5. Let&#39;s set 10! a = 6! b = 5! c. Let’s choose a = 1. Then, 10! = 3628800. So, 6! b = 3628800 ⇒ b = 3628800 / 720 = 5040. Similarly, 5! c = 3628800 ⇒ c = 3628800 / 120 = 30240.Therefore, the polynomial is x^10 + 5040 x^6 + 30240 x^5.Now, the original coefficients are 1, 5040, 30240. First derivative: 10x^9 + 30240 x^5 + 151200 x^4. Coefficients: 10, 30240, 151200. Second derivative: 90x^8 + 151200 x^4 + 604800 x^3. Coefficients: 90, 151200, 604800. Third derivative: 720x^7 + 604800 x^3 + 1814400 x^2. Coefficients: 720, 604800, 1814400. Fourth derivative: 5040x^6 + 1814400 x^2 + 3628800 x. Coefficients: 5040, 1814400, 3628800. Fifth derivative: 30240x^5 + 3628800 x + 3628800. Coefficients: 30240, 3628800, 3628800. Sixth derivative: 151200x^4 + 3628800. Coefficients: 151200, 3628800. Seventh derivative: 604800x^3. Coefficient: 604800. Eighth derivative: 1814400x^2. Coefficient: 1814400. Ninth derivative: 3628800x. Coefficient: 3628800. Tenth derivative: 3628800. Coefficient: 3628800.Now, compiling all coefficients from all derivatives:Original: 1, 5040, 30240.First derivative: 10, 30240, 151200.Second derivative: 90, 151200, 604800.Third derivative: 720, 604800, 1814400.Fourth derivative: 5040, 1814400, 3628800.Fifth derivative: 30240, 3628800, 3628800.Sixth derivative: 151200, 3628800.Seventh derivative: 604800.Eighth derivative: 1814400.Ninth derivative: 3628800.Tenth derivative: 3628800.Distinct numbers: 1, 10, 90, 720, 5040, 151200, 604800, 1814400, 30240, 3628800. Total of 10 distinct numbers.Wait, this also results in 10 distinct numbers. Interesting. So, even with a different polynomial construction, we still end up with 10 distinct numbers. Therefore, it&#39;s reinforcing the idea that 10 is the minimal number.But in this case, the original polynomial has three coefficients: 1, 5040, 30240. The first derivative adds 10, 151200. Second derivative adds 90, 604800. Third derivative adds 720, 1814400. Fourth derivative adds 5040 (already in original), 3628800. Fifth derivative adds 3628800. So, total distinct numbers are 1, 10, 90, 720, 5040, 151200, 604800, 1814400, 30240, 3628800. Ten numbers.Therefore, regardless of the construction, it seems that 10 is the minimal number of distinct numbers.But wait, let&#39;s think again. In the first example, the polynomial was designed with a chain of coefficients leading to 10 distinct numbers, and in this second example, another polynomial also leads to 10 distinct numbers. Both approaches give 10, suggesting that 10 is indeed the minimal.But can we go lower? Let&#39;s see.Suppose we construct a polynomial with more overlapping coefficients. For example, let&#39;s have a term a x^10 and a term b x^5 such that 10! a = 5! b = c. Additionally, have a term d x^8 such that 8! d = c. Then, the 10th derivative, 5th derivative, and 8th derivative all have the same constant term c. Then, in the original polynomial, a = c/10!, b = c/5!, d = c/8!.So, original coefficients: c/10!, c/5!, c/8!.If we set c=10!, then a=1, b=10!/5! = 30240, d=10!/8! = 90.Original coefficients: 1, 30240, 90.First derivative: 10x^9 + 5*30240 x^4 + 8*90 x^7 = 10x^9 + 151200 x^4 + 720 x^7.Coefficients: 10, 151200, 720.Second derivative: 90x^8 + 720*7 x^6 + 151200*4 x^3 = 90x^8 + 5040 x^6 + 604800 x^3.Coefficients: 90, 5040, 604800.Third derivative: 720x^7 + 5040*6 x^5 + 604800*3 x^2 = 720x^7 + 30240 x^5 + 1814400 x^2.Coefficients: 720, 30240, 1814400.Fourth derivative: 5040x^6 + 30240*5 x^4 + 1814400*2 x = 5040x^6 + 151200 x^4 + 3628800 x.Coefficients: 5040, 151200, 3628800.Fifth derivative: 30240x^5 + 151200*4 x^3 + 3628800 = 30240x^5 + 604800 x^3 + 3628800.Coefficients: 30240, 604800, 3628800.Sixth derivative: 151200x^4 + 604800*3 x^2 = 151200x^4 + 1814400 x^2.Coefficients: 151200, 1814400.Seventh derivative: 604800x^3 + 1814400*2 x = 604800x^3 + 3628800 x.Coefficients: 604800, 3628800.Eighth derivative: 1814400x^2 + 3628800.Coefficients: 1814400, 3628800.Ninth derivative: 3628800x.Coefficient: 3628800.Tenth derivative: 3628800.So, compiling all coefficients:Original: 1, 30240, 90.First derivative: 10, 151200, 720.Second derivative: 90, 5040, 604800.Third derivative: 720, 30240, 1814400.Fourth derivative: 5040, 151200, 3628800.Fifth derivative: 30240, 604800, 3628800.Sixth derivative: 151200, 1814400.Seventh derivative: 604800, 3628800.Eighth derivative: 1814400, 3628800.Ninth derivative: 3628800.Tenth derivative: 3628800.Distinct numbers: 1, 10, 90, 720, 5040, 151200, 604800, 1814400, 30240, 3628800. Total of 10 distinct numbers again.Therefore, even with this more complex polynomial, we still end up with 10 distinct numbers. It seems that no matter how we arrange the polynomial, we can&#39;t get below 10 distinct numbers. Therefore, the minimal number is 10.But to confirm, let&#39;s see if there&#39;s any possible way to have fewer. Suppose we can find a polynomial where a coefficient in one derivative equals a coefficient in another derivative or original polynomial with the same sign. For example, having the same number appear in two different places.But in the previous examples, we already see that numbers like 3628800 appear multiple times, but since they are already counted once, it doesn&#39;t increase the total. But can we have another number appearing in two different places?For instance, in the original polynomial, if we have a coefficient that&#39;s the same as a coefficient in a derivative. For example, suppose the original polynomial has a coefficient 10, and in the first derivative, there is also a coefficient 10. But in the original polynomial, 10 is the coefficient of x^9, and in the first derivative, 10 is the coefficient of x^9 from the derivative of x^10. However, in the construction where original coefficients are 1, 10, 90, etc., the 10 is already in the original polynomial and the first derivative. Therefore, it&#39;s already counted.But does this help reduce the total count? No, because 10 is already considered once.Therefore, the conclusion is that the minimal number of distinct numbers Vasya could have written down is 10.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2df99828></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2df99828><span class="icon" data-v-2df99828>✅:</span>To determine the minimum number of distinct numbers Vasya could have written down, we need to construct a polynomial such that the coefficients of the polynomial and all its derivatives result in the fewest unique numbers. Here&#39;s the systematic approach:1. Understanding Derivatives: Each derivative of a polynomial ( P(x) ) reduces its degree by 1. The coefficients of each derivative are the original coefficients multiplied by their respective exponents&#39; factorial terms. For example, the ( k )-th derivative of ( a_n x^n ) is ( a_n frac{n!}{(n-k)!} x^{n-k} ).2. Strategic Polynomial Construction: To minimize distinct numbers, we design a polynomial where coefficients, when multiplied by factorial terms from derivatives, result in repeated values. A key insight is that each derivative&#39;s coefficients can be made to overlap with those from previous steps.3. Example Construction:   - Consider a polynomial ( P(x) = x^{10} + 10x^9 + 90x^8 + 720x^7 + 5040x^6 + 30240x^5 + 151200x^4 + 604800x^3 + 1814400x^2 + 3628800x + 3628800 ).   - The coefficients are chosen such that each term&#39;s coefficient, when derived, results in the next term&#39;s coefficient (e.g., ( 10 times 10 = 90 ), ( 90 times 8 = 720 ), etc.).4. Derivative Analysis:   - Each derivative of this polynomial produces coefficients that are already present in the original polynomial or its higher derivatives. For instance:     - The first derivative&#39;s coefficients are ( 10, 90, 720, ldots, 3628800 ), all of which are in the original set.     - Subsequent derivatives similarly cycle through these coefficients, reducing the highest degree term each time.5. Resulting Distinct Numbers:   - The original polynomial has coefficients ( 1, 10, 90, 720, 5040, 30240, 151200, 604800, 1814400, 3628800 ), totaling 10 distinct numbers.   - All derivatives&#39; coefficients are subsets of these values, confirming no new numbers are introduced.Final Answer: The minimum number of different numbers Vasya could have ended up with is boxed{10}.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2df99828></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2df99828><span class="icon" data-v-2df99828>🔑:</span>Given that the polynomial ( P(x) ) is of degree 10, it has the form:[ P(x) = a_{10}x^{10} + a_9x^9 + a_8x^8 + dots + a_1x + a_0, ]where ( a_{10} neq 0 ).1.

The problem gives the lengths of the two parallel sides (the bases) as 25 and 4 units. The non-parallel sides (the legs) are 20 and 13 units long. Hmm, trapezoid with bases 25 and 4, legs 20 and 13. Let me visualize this. A trapezoid has two sides that are parallel, and the other two are not. The height is the perpendicular distance between the two bases. I remember that the area of a trapezoid is given by the formula (1/2)*(base1 + base2)*height, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re asking for the area here. They just want the height. So maybe if I can find the area through another method, I could solve for height? But I don&#39;t have the area given here. Hmm. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem somehow. If I can form right triangles with the legs and the height. Let me think. If I extend the non-parallel sides, they would meet at a point if the trapezoid was extended, forming a triangle. But not sure if that helps here.Wait, another thought. In a trapezoid, the legs can be thought of as the hypotenuse of right triangles when you drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base. Let me draw this mentally. Suppose the longer base is 25, and the shorter one is 4. If I drop a perpendicular from each end of the shorter base to the longer base, the distance between the two points where the perpendiculars meet the longer base will be 4. The remaining length on the longer base would be 25 - 4 = 21, which is divided between the two sides. Let me call the left side segment x and the right side segment 21 - x. Then, the legs of the trapezoid (20 and 13) would be the hypotenuses of the right triangles formed by these segments and the height h.So, for the left triangle with hypotenuse 20, the base is x and height is h, so by Pythagoras: x² + h² = 20². For the right triangle with hypotenuse 13, the base is 21 - x and height is h, so (21 - x)² + h² = 13². Now, I have two equations:1. x² + h² = 4002. (21 - x)² + h² = 169If I subtract the second equation from the first, I can eliminate h² and solve for x.So, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:x² + h² - [(21 - x)² + h²] = 400 - 169Simplifying:x² - (441 - 42x + x²) = 231x² - 441 + 42x - x² = 231The x² terms cancel out:-441 + 42x = 231Adding 441 to both sides:42x = 231 + 44142x = 672Divide both sides by 42:x = 672 / 42x = 16So x is 16. Then plugging back into equation 1:16² + h² = 400256 + h² = 400h² = 400 - 256h² = 144Taking the square root:h = 12Wait, so the height is 12? Let me check if that makes sense. Let me verify with the other equation. If x = 16, then the right triangle&#39;s base is 21 - 16 = 5. Then check 5² + h² = 13²:25 + 144 = 169169 = 169, which is correct. So yes, h = 12. That seems to work. So the height is 12 units. Alternatively, another way to approach this problem could be by using the formula for the height of a trapezoid when the lengths of both bases and legs are known. I think that formula might involve some trigonometry or coordinate geometry. Let me see.Alternatively, placing the trapezoid on a coordinate system. Let me set the longer base of 25 on the x-axis from (0,0) to (25,0). The shorter base of 4 is parallel, so it&#39;s somewhere above. Let me denote the coordinates of the other two vertices as (a,h) and (b,h), since they are on the line y = h. The distance between these two points should be 4, so the distance between (a,h) and (b,h) is |b - a| = 4. The legs connect (0,0) to (a,h) and (25,0) to (b,h). The lengths of these legs are 20 and 13, respectively. So, using the distance formula:From (0,0) to (a,h): sqrt((a - 0)^2 + (h - 0)^2) = 20, so a² + h² = 400.From (25,0) to (b,h): sqrt((b - 25)^2 + (h - 0)^2) = 13, so (b - 25)^2 + h² = 169.Also, since |b - a| = 4, we can say b = a + 4 (assuming a &lt; b, which makes sense if the trapezoid is convex). So substituting b = a + 4 into the second equation:(a + 4 - 25)^2 + h² = 169Simplify (a - 21)^2 + h² = 169Now, from the first equation, a² + h² = 400. So subtract the second equation from the first:[a² + h²] - [(a - 21)^2 + h²] = 400 - 169Simplify:a² - (a² - 42a + 441) = 231a² - a² + 42a - 441 = 23142a - 441 = 23142a = 672a = 16Then, h² = 400 - a² = 400 - 256 = 144, so h = 12. Same result. So regardless of the method, the height is 12.Wait, so seems like both methods lead to h = 12. That gives me more confidence. Let me just recap to make sure there&#39;s no mistake.The key idea is that when you have a trapezoid, the difference in the lengths of the bases (25 - 4 = 21) is distributed as two segments on the longer base when you drop the heights from the ends of the shorter base. These two segments and the legs form right triangles with the height. Solving for the segments using the Pythagorean theorem gives the height. Alternatively, using coordinate geometry by placing the trapezoid on a coordinate plane and applying the distance formula also leads to the same equations. Either way, solving the system of equations gives h = 12. So I think that&#39;s the correct answer.I don&#39;t see any errors in the steps. The key was to realize that the difference in the bases is 21, which splits into two parts, x and 21 - x, which are the bases of the right triangles with hypotenuses 20 and 13. Then solving for x gives the necessary information to find h. Both approaches lead to the same value, so I think the height is indeed 12.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2df99828></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2df99828><span class="icon" data-v-2df99828>✅:</span>The height of the trapezoid can be determined by analyzing the right triangles formed by its legs and the difference in the lengths of the bases.

We are given a trapezoid with parallel sides AD = 25 and BC = 4, and non-parallel sides AB = 20 and CD = 13. We need to find the height of the trapezoid.  2. Through the vertex C of the smaller base BC of the trapezoid ABCD, draw a perpendicular CK onto the larger base AD.3. Let AD = 25, BC = 4, AB = 20, and CD = 13.4. Next, draw a line from point C parallel to the side AB, intersecting AD at point M. Since CM is parallel to AB, we know that CM = AB = 20.5. Notice that MD = AD - AM = AD - BC = 25 - 4 = 21.6.

So, the problem is about a flying saucer that can jump through the Earth or the Moon, meaning each jump reflects its position over either the Earth or the Moon. The goal is to find the minimum number of jumps needed to go from any point inside the lunar orbit to any other point inside. Hmm.First, let me visualize this. The Earth and Moon are two points in a plane, with the Moon orbiting the Earth. The flying saucer is somewhere inside the orbit. Each jump makes the saucer&#39;s new position such that the midpoint of the jump is either Earth or Moon. So, if the midpoint is Earth, then the new position is symmetric to the old one with respect to Earth. Similarly, if the midpoint is the Moon, it&#39;s symmetric with respect to the Moon.Wait, actually, the midpoint being the Earth means that Earth is the midpoint of segment AA&#39;, right? So, if A is the original position, then A&#39; is such that Earth is exactly halfway between A and A&#39;. So, mathematically, if E is Earth&#39;s position, then A&#39; = 2E - A. Similarly, if the midpoint is the Moon (M), then A&#39; = 2M - A.So each jump is a reflection over either Earth or Moon. That makes sense. So each operation is a translation: reflecting the current position over Earth or Moon. Since reflections can be thought of as transformations in the plane.Now, the question is, starting from any point inside the orbit, can we reach any other point inside using these reflections, and what&#39;s the minimal number of jumps required?First, let&#39;s think about the possible positions after each jump. Let&#39;s denote Earth as point E and Moon as point M. Let&#39;s suppose E is at the origin (0,0) for simplicity, and M is at some point on the circle. Since the Moon&#39;s orbit is circular, but since the saucer is inside the orbit, maybe we can assume the Earth-Moon distance is constant? Wait, but the problem says the Moon is moving in its orbit with a period of one month. However, part (a) doesn&#39;t mention time, just the minimum number of jumps regardless of the Moon&#39;s position. Hmm, but wait, the Moon is moving, so depending on when we make the jumps, the position of the Moon might be different. But part (a) says &quot;the Moon revolves around the Earth along a circular orbit with a period of one month.&quot; But the problem is to determine the minimum number of jumps required for the saucer to jump from any point inside the lunar orbit to any other point. Wait, maybe the Moon&#39;s position is fixed during the jumps? Or do we have to consider that the Moon is moving as time passes?Wait, the problem states: &quot;the flying saucer is located in the plane of the lunar orbit. It can move by jumping through the Moon and the Earth: from an old position (point A) it instantly appears in a new one (at point A&#39;) such that the midpoint of the segment AA&#39; is either the Moon or the Earth. Between jumps, the flying saucer hovers motionlessly in space.&quot;So between jumps, it hovers, and the Moon is moving along its orbit. So if the saucer takes multiple jumps, the Moon&#39;s position could be different each time? Because each jump happens at a different time, during which the Moon has moved. So the Moon&#39;s position is a function of time.But then, part (a) is asking for the minimal number of jumps required, regardless of the time? Or do we have to take into account that the Moon is moving?Wait, the problem says &quot;the Moon revolves around the Earth along a circular orbit with a period of one month.&quot; But when they say &quot;the flying saucer can move by jumping through the Moon and the Earth,&quot; does the Moon&#39;s position matter for each jump? For example, if the saucer wants to jump with the Moon as the midpoint, does it have to do so when the Moon is at a specific position?But the problem statement isn&#39;t entirely clear. Wait, let me check again.It says: &quot;the midpoint of the segment AA&#39; is either the Moon or the Earth.&quot; So, when the saucer jumps, it can choose to make the midpoint either the Earth or the Moon. However, since the Moon is moving, the position of the Moon at the time of the jump is important. Therefore, the Moon&#39;s position is time-dependent, so each jump can use the Moon&#39;s current position at that moment.But if the saucer can choose when to jump, it might be able to choose the Moon&#39;s position. However, the problem states &quot;the Moon revolves around the Earth along a circular orbit with a period of one month.&quot; So, the Moon is continuously moving. The saucer can jump at any time, but each jump is instantaneous. So between jumps, the saucer hovers, but during that time, the Moon moves along its orbit.Therefore, each time the saucer jumps, the Moon is in a different position. Therefore, each jump with respect to the Moon would use the Moon&#39;s current position at that time.But this complicates things, because the Moon&#39;s position is a continuous function of time. However, the problem is asking for the minimal number of jumps. So maybe we can choose the timing of the jumps such that the Moon is in convenient positions?Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimal number of jumps required to reach any point from any other point. So maybe regardless of the Moon&#39;s motion, but perhaps assuming that the Moon can be at any position in its orbit when needed. Wait, but that might not be possible if the saucer needs to make multiple jumps in sequence, each time with the Moon at different positions. Alternatively, perhaps the Moon&#39;s position is fixed. Wait, the problem says &quot;the Moon revolves around the Earth along a circular orbit with a period of one month.&quot; So, the Moon is moving, but we can choose when to perform the jumps. So if we can choose the exact moments to jump, perhaps we can have the Moon at any desired position for each jump, as long as we wait the necessary time.But the problem says the saucer can jump &quot;instantly,&quot; so the jumps are instantaneous, but between jumps, the saucer hovers motionlessly. So if the saucer wants to make a jump with the Moon at a certain position, it might have to wait until the Moon is in that position. But since the Moon is moving continuously, and the period is a month, but the problem doesn&#39;t restrict the time, only the number of jumps. Therefore, perhaps the minimal number of jumps is independent of the Moon&#39;s motion, because we can choose to perform the jumps at times when the Moon is in the required positions.But maybe not. Wait, part (a) is only about the number of jumps, not about the time. So even if the Moon is moving, the number of jumps is determined by the transformations possible with reflections over Earth and Moon (with Moon possibly in different positions).Alternatively, perhaps the Moon is considered fixed for part (a). But the problem says it&#39;s revolving. Hmm. The problem is a bit ambiguous.Wait, in part (b), it says &quot;using an unlimited number of jumps, can jump... in any given amount of time, for example, in a second.&quot; So time is a factor there, implying that in part (a), time is not a factor, just the number of jumps. Therefore, perhaps in part (a), we can assume the Moon is fixed at some position, because the minimal number of jumps would not depend on waiting for the Moon to move. Alternatively, maybe the Moon&#39;s position can be arbitrary for each jump. That is, for each jump, you can choose to reflect over Earth or over Moon, but Moon is at any point on its orbit. Wait, but the saucer can&#39;t control the Moon&#39;s position; the Moon is moving on its own. So when you choose to jump over the Moon, you have to take the Moon&#39;s current position.But if the problem is to find the minimal number of jumps regardless of the time taken, then perhaps you can choose the timing of the jumps such that the Moon is in any desired position. Since the Moon is moving continuously, given enough time between jumps, you can have the Moon at any position. But since part (a) is about the minimal number of jumps, not the minimal time, perhaps we can assume that between jumps, we can wait as long as needed to have the Moon in a convenient position. Therefore, effectively, for each jump, we can choose the Moon&#39;s position anywhere on the orbit.Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the Moon is fixed. The problem statement says &quot;the Moon revolves around the Earth along a circular orbit with a period of one month,&quot; but for the purposes of solving the problem, perhaps we can take a snapshot where the Moon is at a particular position, and all reflections are with respect to that fixed Moon and Earth. But then, if the Moon is fixed, then reflecting over Moon would only give one possible transformation, but since in reality, the Moon is moving, reflecting over different positions of the Moon would give different transformations. So maybe the problem intends that the Moon is moving, so each reflection over the Moon can be done when the Moon is at any point on the orbit.Wait, the problem says &quot;the flying saucer is located in the plane of the lunar orbit.&quot; So the lunar orbit is a circle in the plane, and the saucer is somewhere inside that circle. The Moon is moving along the circumference, Earth is at the center.So, to model this, Earth is at the center (0,0), Moon is moving on a circle of radius R (lunar orbit radius). The saucer is inside the lunar orbit, so its distance from Earth is less than R.Each jump is a reflection over Earth or over the current position of the Moon. Since the Moon is moving, each time we reflect over the Moon, it&#39;s a different point if done at a different time.But for part (a), we need to find the minimal number of jumps to go from any point inside to any other point. If reflections over the Moon can be done at any point on the lunar orbit, then effectively, we can reflect over any point on the lunar orbit (since the Moon can be there at some time). So perhaps the problem reduces to: using reflections over Earth (fixed) and reflections over any point on the lunar orbit (since Moon can be anywhere), what&#39;s the minimal number of reflections needed to connect any two points inside.But how do reflections over points work? A reflection over a point (point reflection) is an inversion through that point. So reflecting a point A over point E results in a point A&#39; such that E is the midpoint of A and A&#39;. So the transformation is A&#39; = 2E - A. Similarly, reflecting over the Moon (at position M) gives A&#39; = 2M - A.Therefore, each reflection is a translation in the plane. Specifically, reflecting over Earth (which is the origin) gives A&#39; = -A (if E is at the origin). Wait, if E is at the origin, then reflection over E would be A&#39; = -A. But if the saucer is at position A, then reflecting over E would place it at -A. But the lunar orbit has radius R, and the saucer is inside the orbit, so |A| &lt; R. Then |-A| = |A| &lt; R, so still inside. Similarly, reflecting over Moon at position M gives A&#39; = 2M - A. Now, since M is on the lunar orbit, |M| = R. So |A&#39;| = |2M - A|. If A is inside, is A&#39; inside?Not necessarily. For example, if M is at (R,0), and A is at (0,0), then A&#39; would be (2R,0), which is outside the lunar orbit. But the problem states that the saucer is starting inside and wants to reach another point inside. So perhaps the jumps can result in positions outside, but we need to get back inside? Wait, but the problem says &quot;the flying saucer to jump from any point inside the lunar orbit to any other point inside the lunar orbit.&quot; So maybe all intermediate jumps can go outside, as long as the final point is inside. But actually, the problem doesn&#39;t specify that the saucer must stay inside, just that it starts and ends inside. So perhaps jumps can go outside, but since the saucer is moving by reflections, it can go outside and then come back.But the key is to find the minimal number of jumps. Let&#39;s consider that each jump is a reflection over Earth or Moon (at any position on the orbit, since we can choose when to jump).Wait, but if we can choose the Moon&#39;s position for each reflection, then effectively, each reflection over the Moon can be over any point on the orbit. Therefore, the set of possible transformations is: reflections over Earth (which is inversion through the origin if Earth is at the origin) and reflections over any point M on the circle of radius R.So, mathematically, the possible transformations are:1. T_E(A) = -A (reflection over Earth)2. For any M on the circle |M| = R, T_M(A) = 2M - A.Now, we need to see what transformations can be achieved by composing these reflections. The question is: what is the minimal number of such transformations needed to map any point A to any point B inside the lunar orbit.Let me consider first what one reflection can do. If we start at point A, reflecting over Earth gives -A. Reflecting over some Moon point M gives 2M - A.If we do two reflections: suppose we first reflect over Earth to get -A, then reflect over some M to get 2M - (-A) = 2M + A. Alternatively, reflect over M1 first: 2M1 - A, then reflect over M2: 2M2 - (2M1 - A) = 2M2 - 2M1 + A. Or reflect over Earth then Earth: -(-A) = A. Similarly, reflecting over Earth then Moon: 2M - (-A) = 2M + A. Reflecting over Moon then Earth: - (2M - A) = -2M + A. Reflecting over two different Moons: 2M2 - (2M1 - A) = 2(M2 - M1) + A.So with two reflections, you can get translations like 2(M2 - M1) + A or 2M + A, or -2M + A, etc. Similarly, with three reflections, you can get more combinations.But we need to reach any point B from any A. Let&#39;s consider the difference vector B - A. We need to find transformations that can achieve any translation.Wait, but each reflection is not just a translation; it&#39;s a combination of inversion and translation. Let&#39;s model this algebraically.Let’s assume Earth is at the origin, and the Moon is at a point M on the circle of radius R. Let’s represent points as complex numbers for simplicity.Let’s denote the initial position as a complex number z. Reflecting over Earth gives -z. Reflecting over Moon gives 2M - z.If we perform two reflections: first over Moon M1, then over Moon M2, the result is 2M2 - (2M1 - z) = 2(M2 - M1) + z. So this is equivalent to a translation by 2(M2 - M1).Similarly, reflecting over Earth and then Moon M: 2M - (-z) = 2M + z.Reflecting over Moon M and then Earth: - (2M - z) = -2M + z.So, composing two reflections can give us translations by vectors like 2(M2 - M1), 2M, -2M, etc.If we can choose M1 and M2 as any points on the lunar orbit (radius R), then the vector 2(M2 - M1) can be any vector of length up to 4R (since the maximum distance between M1 and M2 is 2R, so 2*(2R) = 4R). But since M1 and M2 are on the circle, the vector M2 - M1 can be any chord of the circle, so 2(M2 - M1) can be any vector with magnitude up to 4R and direction depending on M1 and M2.However, the translations we can achieve are limited by the possible M1 and M2. But since we can choose any M1 and M2 on the circle, the set of possible translation vectors is the set of all vectors 2(M2 - M1) for M1, M2 on the circle. This forms a set of vectors which are all possible chords scaled by 2. The set of such vectors would cover all possible directions, but the magnitude is up to 4R.Similarly, reflecting over Earth and then Moon gives 2M + z. So this is equivalent to adding 2M to z. Since M can be any point on the circle, 2M can be any vector of length 2R in any direction. Similarly, reflecting over Moon and then Earth gives -2M + z, which is equivalent to subtracting 2M from z.So, with two reflections, we can add or subtract any vector of length 2R, or add any vector that&#39;s twice the difference between two Moon positions.But how does this help us reach any point inside the orbit?Let’s consider that we need to get from point A to point B, both inside the lunar orbit (|A|, |B| &lt; R). Let&#39;s set Earth at the origin for simplicity.Suppose we start at point A. Let&#39;s try to see what operations we can perform.First, if we reflect over Earth, we go to -A. If we reflect over a Moon at position M, we go to 2M - A.But since the Moon can be anywhere on the orbit, we can choose M such that 2M - A is any point on the circle of radius 2R centered at -A. Wait, no. If M is on the circle of radius R, then 2M - A is a point such that 2M is on the circle of radius 2R, so 2M - A is the set of points obtained by taking the circle of radius 2R and translating it by -A. So the possible positions after one jump (reflecting over Moon) are all points of the form 2M - A where M is on the circle of radius R.Similarly, reflecting over Earth gives -A.Now, if we do two jumps: Suppose we first reflect over Moon M1 to get 2M1 - A, then reflect over Moon M2 to get 2M2 - (2M1 - A) = 2(M2 - M1) + A. Alternatively, first reflect over Earth to get -A, then reflect over Moon M to get 2M - (-A) = 2M + A.So with two jumps, we can reach points of the form 2(M2 - M1) + A or 2M + A.Similarly, three jumps would allow more combinations. But we need to see if by composing these operations, we can reach any point B from A.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the group generated by these reflections. Since each reflection is an involution (doing it twice brings you back), the group might be generated by the reflections over Earth and over all possible Moon positions.But since the Moon positions are dense (if we can choose any M on the circle), then the group might be the entire Euclidean group, but restricted to translations and inversions.Wait, but each reflection over a Moon at M is a translation by 2M followed by a reflection over the origin? Wait, no. Reflecting over M is the transformation z → 2M - z. Which is equivalent to a reflection over the point M. Similarly, reflecting over Earth is a reflection over the origin.In the plane, the composition of two reflections over points results in a translation. Specifically, reflecting over point M1 and then M2 results in a translation by 2(M2 - M1). Similarly, reflecting over the origin and then M results in a translation by 2M.Therefore, the group generated by reflections over the origin and all points M on the circle of radius R would include all translations by vectors of the form 2(M2 - M1) and 2M, as well as the reflections themselves.But translations can be composed by adding vectors. So if we can generate translations by any vector, then combined with reflections, we can reach any point.However, the translations we can generate are limited by the vectors 2(M2 - M1) and 2M. If R is fixed, then the set of possible translations is all vectors 2(M2 - M1) where M1 and M2 are on the circle of radius R, and all vectors 2M where M is on the circle.But can these translations generate any arbitrary translation vector? Let&#39;s see.Suppose we need to translate by a vector v. Can we write v as a combination of vectors of the form 2(M2 - M1) and 2M?If we can, then by composing such translations, we can reach any point. However, since M1 and M2 are on the circle of radius R, the vectors M are of length R, so 2M are of length 2R, and 2(M2 - M1) can be of length up to 4R.But even so, the set of all such translations may not cover the entire plane. For example, if R is 1, then 2M can reach any vector of length 2, and 2(M2 - M1) can reach any vector up to length 4. But can these generate any vector in the plane?Actually, if we can choose M1 and M2 freely on the circle, then 2(M2 - M1) can be any vector in the plane, because the differences M2 - M1 can be any vector with magnitude up to 2R. Wait, no. The set of all M2 - M1 for M1, M2 on the circle of radius R is the set of all chords of the circle. The maximum length is 2R (diametrically opposed), and the minimum is 0. So 2(M2 - M1) would be vectors of length up to 4R, but directionally covering all directions.But if we can combine multiple translations, then perhaps we can reach any vector. For example, if we can translate in any direction by some vector, and we can do multiple such translations, then we can reach any point via vector addition.However, the problem is whether the translations generated by 2(M2 - M1) and 2M are sufficient to span the entire plane. Since M1 and M2 can be any points on the circle, the vectors 2(M2 - M1) can be any vector in the plane. Wait, is that true?Actually, the set { M2 - M1 | M1, M2 on circle of radius R } is the set of all vectors that can be formed by subtracting two points on the circle. This set is all vectors whose length is less than or equal to 2R. So scaling by 2 gives vectors up to 4R. But even more importantly, the directions of these vectors cover all possible directions. Therefore, the set of translations generated by 2(M2 - M1) includes all vectors in the plane with length up to 4R in any direction.Similarly, the set of translations generated by 2M are vectors pointing in any direction (since M can be any point on the circle) with length 2R.Now, if we can compose such translations, then by adding multiple translation vectors, we can reach any point in the plane. For example, suppose we want to translate by a vector v. If we can write v as a sum of vectors of the form 2(M2 - M1) and 2M, then we can achieve that translation by composing the corresponding reflections.But since the translations generated by 2(M2 - M1) and 2M can have any direction, and we can take multiple such translations (by performing multiple pairs of reflections), we can indeed reach any vector in the plane. Therefore, the group generated by these operations is the entire translation group of the plane, plus the reflections.However, we are interested in reaching any point from any other point. Since translations allow us to move anywhere, combined with the reflections (which can invert the direction), we should be able to reach any point.But the key question is: how many jumps (reflections) are needed to compose such a translation. Each translation requires two reflections (over two Moons or a Moon and Earth). Therefore, to perform a translation, we need two jumps. Similarly, to perform a reflection over Earth, we need one jump.So, starting from point A, if we need to reach point B, we can consider the vector from A to B. If we can decompose that vector into a sum of translation vectors achievable by the allowed operations, then the number of jumps would be twice the number of translations needed.But since translations can be combined, if we can reach any translation in one go (with two jumps), then perhaps two jumps are enough. Wait, but how?Wait, let&#39;s suppose we want to go from A to B. Let&#39;s denote the vector from A to B as v = B - A. If we can find a translation operator T such that T(A) = B, then applying T would require a certain number of jumps.If T is achieved by two reflections, then two jumps. However, T might not be directly achievable by a single translation. But if we can express v as a single translation vector achievable by two reflections, then yes.But the translations achievable by two reflections are of the form 2(M2 - M1) or 2M + ... Wait, actually, reflecting twice over Moons gives a translation by 2(M2 - M1). Reflecting over Earth and then Moon gives a translation by 2M. So these are two different types of translations.Suppose we need to translate by a vector v. If we can write v as 2(M2 - M1), then two jumps. If v can be written as 2M, then two jumps (reflect over Earth then Moon M). But if v cannot be written as either, then we might need more jumps.But since we can combine translations by composing multiple two-jump operations, each adding a translation vector. So, for example, to translate by v = v1 + v2, we can first translate by v1 (two jumps), then translate by v2 (another two jumps), totaling four jumps. However, this is not efficient.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a smarter way. Suppose we can find a translation that directly gives v by combining different operations.Alternatively, let&#39;s think in terms of linear algebra. If we can generate any translation vector with two jumps, then we can reach any point in two jumps. But clearly, that&#39;s not the case because the translations are limited in magnitude. For example, if R is 1, the maximum translation in one two-jump operation is 4 units (if M2 - M1 is a diameter). But if the required translation is larger than 4 units, we need multiple operations.However, since the saucer is moving from one point inside the lunar orbit to another, both |A| and |B| are less than R. So the distance between A and B is at most 2R. Therefore, the translation vector v = B - A has |v| ≤ |B| + |A| &lt; 2R. But the maximum translation we can achieve in one two-jump operation is 4R (if M2 - M1 is a diameter, then 2(M2 - M1) has length 4R). Therefore, a single two-jump operation can translate by up to 4R, which is more than enough to cover any translation needed between two points inside the orbit.But wait, the direction also matters. Can we choose M1 and M2 such that 2(M2 - M1) equals any vector v with |v| ≤ 4R?Yes. Because for any vector v, we can set M2 = M1 + v/2. However, M1 and M2 must lie on the circle of radius R. Therefore, given a vector v, we need to find M1 and M2 on the circle such that M2 = M1 + v/2. This requires that |M1 + v/2| = R.But this is possible only if the vector v/2 is such that M1 + v/2 lies on the circle. However, M1 is on the circle, so we can think of this as M2 being the reflection of M1 over the point v/2. Not sure.Alternatively, for any vector v, can we find two points M1 and M2 on the circle such that M2 - M1 = v/2?This is equivalent to finding two points on the circle separated by vector v/2. The existence of such points depends on the length of v/2. Since |v| &lt; 2R (because the distance between A and B is less than 2R), then |v/2| &lt; R. Therefore, the vector v/2 has length less than R, so it&#39;s possible to find two points M1 and M2 on the circle such that M2 - M1 = v/2. Wait, not necessarily. For example, if v/2 is a vector of length greater than 2R, it&#39;s impossible. But since |v| &lt; 2R, |v/2| &lt; R, which is less than the diameter of the circle (which is 2R). So, given two points on a circle, the difference can be any vector up to length 2R. But here, we need the difference to be v/2, which is less than R in length. Therefore, yes, for any vector v with |v/2| ≤ 2R, which is always true since |v| &lt; 2R implies |v/2| &lt; R &lt; 2R, so such points M1 and M2 exist.Wait, actually, given any vector w with |w| ≤ 2R, there exist points M1 and M2 on the circle of radius R such that M2 - M1 = w. This is equivalent to saying that for any vector of length up to 2R, there are two points on the circle separated by that vector. This is true because if you fix M1 at some point, then M2 must lie on the intersection of the circle and the circle centered at M1 + w with radius |w|. The intersection exists as long as |w| ≤ 2R, which it is.Therefore, for any vector v with |v| ≤ 4R, we can write v = 2(M2 - M1) where |M2 - M1| = |v|/2 ≤ 2R, which is possible. But in our case, the translation needed is v = B - A with |v| &lt; 2R. Therefore, |v|/2 &lt; R, so we can certainly find M1 and M2 such that M2 - M1 = v/2. Hence, translating by v requires two jumps: reflect over M1 then over M2.Therefore, in two jumps, we can translate from A to B = A + v = A + 2(M2 - M1). Therefore, two jumps are sufficient to reach any point from any other point.But wait, that seems too good. Let&#39;s test with an example.Suppose Earth is at the origin, and the lunar orbit has radius R = 1. Let’s say the saucer is at point A = (0.5, 0) and wants to go to B = (0, 0.5). The vector v = B - A = (-0.5, 0.5). The length of v is sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707, which is less than 2R = 2. So |v/2| ≈ 0.353 &lt; R = 1. Therefore, there exist points M1 and M2 on the circle such that M2 - M1 = v/2 = (-0.25, 0.25).To find such points M1 and M2, we can set M1 = (x, y) and M2 = M1 + (-0.25, 0.25). Then, since both M1 and M2 must lie on the unit circle:|M1|² = x² + y² = 1|M2|² = (x - 0.25)² + (y + 0.25)² = 1Expanding the second equation:(x - 0.25)² + (y + 0.25)² = x² - 0.5x + 0.0625 + y² + 0.5y + 0.0625 = (x² + y²) - 0.5x + 0.5y + 0.125 = 1 - 0.5x + 0.5y + 0.125 = 1.125 - 0.5x + 0.5y = 1Therefore, 1.125 - 0.5x + 0.5y = 1 =&gt; -0.5x + 0.5y = -0.125 =&gt; -x + y = -0.25 =&gt; y = x - 0.25Now, substitute y = x - 0.25 into the first equation:x² + (x - 0.25)² = 1Expand:x² + x² - 0.5x + 0.0625 = 12x² - 0.5x + 0.0625 - 1 = 02x² - 0.5x - 0.9375 = 0Multiply by 16 to eliminate decimals:32x² - 8x - 15 = 0Solve using quadratic formula:x = [8 ± sqrt(64 + 1920)] / 64 = [8 ± sqrt(1984)] / 64 ≈ [8 ± 44.54] / 64Positive solution:x ≈ (52.54)/64 ≈ 0.821Then y = 0.821 - 0.25 = 0.571Check |M1|² ≈ 0.821² + 0.571² ≈ 0.674 + 0.326 ≈ 1.0, which works.M2 = M1 + (-0.25, 0.25) ≈ (0.821 - 0.25, 0.571 + 0.25) ≈ (0.571, 0.821)Check |M2|² ≈ 0.571² + 0.821² ≈ 0.326 + 0.674 ≈ 1.0, which also works.Therefore, such points M1 and M2 exist. Therefore, reflecting over M1 and then M2 translates the saucer by v = 2(M2 - M1) = 2*(-0.25, 0.25) = (-0.5, 0.5), which is exactly the vector needed to go from A to B.Therefore, in two jumps, the saucer can go from A to B. But wait, in this case, the starting point is A, first jump is reflection over M1, resulting in 2M1 - A, then reflection over M2, resulting in 2M2 - (2M1 - A) = 2(M2 - M1) + A = v + A = B.Yes, that works. So two jumps are sufficient. But wait, what if the required translation vector is not achievable in one step? For example, if the vector is larger than 4R? But since the saucer is moving within the lunar orbit (radius R), the maximum distance between A and B is 2R, so the translation vector has length at most 2R, and therefore, |v/2| = R, so M2 - M1 = v/2 has length R. Since M1 and M2 are on the circle of radius R, the maximum possible difference is 2R (diametrically opposed). But we need a difference of R. Is that achievable?Wait, in the previous example, we needed a difference of approximately 0.353R, which is less than R. But what if v/2 has length exactly R? For example, suppose v = (2R, 0). Then v/2 = (R, 0). So we need M2 - M1 = (R, 0). So M2 = M1 + (R, 0). But if M1 is on the circle of radius R, then M1 + (R, 0) would have to be on the circle as well. Let&#39;s assume M1 = (-R, 0). Then M2 = (-R, 0) + (R, 0) = (0,0), which is Earth, not on the lunar orbit. So that doesn&#39;t work. Alternatively, if M1 is somewhere else.Wait, suppose R = 1. Let&#39;s say we need M2 - M1 = (1,0). So M2 = M1 + (1,0). Since both M1 and M2 must lie on the unit circle.Let M1 = (x, y), then M2 = (x + 1, y). The condition is that x² + y² = 1 and (x + 1)² + y² = 1.Subtracting the first equation from the second:(x + 1)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 0 =&gt; 2x + 1 = 0 =&gt; x = -0.5Then y² = 1 - x² = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 =&gt; y = ±√0.75 = ±√3/2 ≈ ±0.866Therefore, M1 = (-0.5, √3/2), M2 = (-0.5 + 1, √3/2) = (0.5, √3/2). Both are on the unit circle:(-0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1(0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1Therefore, such points exist. Therefore, even for a translation vector v = (2,0), which would be from A = (0,0) to B = (2,0), but wait, B must be inside the lunar orbit. If R = 1, then B cannot be at (2,0), which is outside. But since B must be inside, the maximum distance from Earth is less than R. Therefore, the translation vectors needed will have |v| &lt; 2R, but |v/2| &lt; R. Therefore, the previous example with v/2 = (1,0) would require B = A + (2,0), but if A is inside, B would be outside. But the problem states that both points are inside, so we need to translate within the inside.Wait, maybe I confused something. If we are translating the saucer&#39;s position by v = B - A, and both A and B are inside, then |v| ≤ |A| + |B| &lt; 2R. Therefore, |v/2| &lt; R. So the difference M2 - M1 = v/2 has magnitude less than R, and we can always find such M1 and M2 on the circle of radius R. As shown in the previous example, even for v/2 = (R,0), we can find M1 and M2.Therefore, in general, for any translation vector v with |v/2| &lt; R, there exist points M1 and M2 on the lunar orbit such that M2 - M1 = v/2. Therefore, two reflections over M1 and M2 would translate the saucer by v, moving it from A to B.However, there is a catch. If the saucer is at position A, and we reflect it over M1 to get 2M1 - A, then reflect over M2 to get 2M2 - (2M1 - A) = 2(M2 - M1) + A = A + v. So the final position is B. But we need to ensure that after each reflection, the saucer is still inside the lunar orbit. Wait, the problem doesn&#39;t specify that the saucer has to stay inside during the jumps, only that it starts and ends inside. Therefore, even if intermediate jumps take it outside, it&#39;s acceptable as long as the final position is inside.But in our case, the final position is B, which is inside. The intermediate position after the first reflection is 2M1 - A. Since |M1| = R and |A| &lt; R, the distance from Earth after the first jump is |2M1 - A|. Let&#39;s compute its magnitude:|2M1 - A| ≤ 2|M1| + |A| &lt; 2R + R = 3R.So it&#39;s possible that after the first jump, the saucer is outside the lunar orbit (radius R). But the problem allows that, as long as the final position is inside. Therefore, two jumps are sufficient.But wait, in the example above, translating from A to B = A + v, the intermediate point is 2M1 - A, which could be outside. But the problem doesn&#39;t restrict being outside during jumps, so that&#39;s fine.Therefore, it seems that two jumps are sufficient to go from any A to any B inside the lunar orbit. But let&#39;s verify with another example.Suppose we start at A = (0.5, 0) and want to go to B = (-0.5, 0). The vector v = (-1, 0). Then v/2 = (-0.5, 0). So we need M2 - M1 = (-0.5, 0). Therefore, M2 = M1 + (-0.5, 0). Let&#39;s find M1 on the unit circle such that M2 is also on the unit circle.Let M1 = (x, y). Then M2 = (x - 0.5, y). The conditions are:x² + y² = 1(x - 0.5)² + y² = 1Subtracting the first equation from the second:(x - 0.5)² - x² = 0 =&gt; x² - x + 0.25 - x² = -x + 0.25 = 0 =&gt; x = 0.25Then y² = 1 - x² = 1 - 0.0625 = 0.9375 =&gt; y = ±√0.9375 ≈ ±0.9682Therefore, M1 = (0.25, ≈0.9682), M2 = (-0.25, ≈0.9682). Both are on the unit circle:0.25² + (0.9682)^2 ≈ 0.0625 + 0.9375 ≈ 1(-0.25)^2 + (0.9682)^2 ≈ same.Therefore, reflecting over M1 then M2 would translate A by v = -1, taking it from (0.5, 0) to (-0.5, 0) in two jumps.But wait, after the first reflection over M1, the saucer is at 2M1 - A = 2*(0.25, 0.9682) - (0.5, 0) = (0.5, 1.9364) - (0.5, 0) = (0, 1.9364). This is outside the lunar orbit (radius 1), but allowed. Then reflecting over M2: 2M2 - (0, 1.9364) = 2*(-0.25, 0.9682) - (0, 1.9364) = (-0.5, 1.9364) - (0, 1.9364) = (-0.5, 0), which is B. So yes, two jumps work.But what if the required translation is zero? If A = B, then zero jumps needed. But the problem says &quot;from any point inside to any other point inside,&quot; so excluding the same point. The minimal number of jumps is two.Wait, but the problem says &quot;minimum number of jumps required for the flying saucer to jump from any point inside the lunar orbit to any other point inside the lunar orbit.&quot; So regardless of the points, what&#39;s the minimal number that works for all pairs.But in some cases, one jump might be enough. For example, if B is the reflection of A over Earth, then one jump suffices. Similarly, if B is the reflection of A over some Moon position, then one jump. But the problem asks for the minimal number that works for any pair of points. So we need to find the maximum minimal number over all possible pairs.For example, some pairs require two jumps, others can be done in one. But the question is to determine the minimal number required such that all pairs can be achieved within that number. So if there exists even one pair that requires two jumps, then the answer is two. But according to our previous analysis, any point can be reached in two jumps. However, some points can be reached in one jump.But the problem is asking for the minimal number of jumps required to go from any point to any other point. Therefore, the answer would be the maximum, over all pairs, of the minimal number of jumps needed for that pair. Since some pairs require two jumps, the answer must be two.Wait, but let&#39;s confirm. Suppose we have two arbitrary points A and B. Can we always reach B from A in at most two jumps?Yes, because we can find a translation vector v = B - A, and then find two Moon positions M1 and M2 such that reflecting over M1 then M2 gives the translation v. Therefore, two jumps.However, if B is the reflection of A over Earth, then one jump is enough. If B is the reflection of A over some Moon position, then one jump. But for arbitrary B, two jumps are needed. Therefore, the minimal number required such that all pairs can be done is two.Therefore, the answer to part (a) is 2.But let&#39;s check another example. Suppose we want to go from A = (0.3, 0.4) to B = (0.1, 0.2). The vector v = (-0.2, -0.2). We need to see if we can find M1 and M2 such that 2(M2 - M1) = v.Then M2 - M1 = (-0.1, -0.1). So M2 = M1 + (-0.1, -0.1). Let&#39;s find M1 on the unit circle.Let M1 = (x, y), then M2 = (x - 0.1, y - 0.1). Both must satisfy x² + y² = 1 and (x - 0.1)^2 + (y - 0.1)^2 = 1.Expand the second equation:x² - 0.2x + 0.01 + y² - 0.2y + 0.01 = 1x² + y² - 0.2x - 0.2y + 0.02 = 1But x² + y² = 1, so substitute:1 - 0.2x - 0.2y + 0.02 = 1 =&gt; -0.2x - 0.2y + 0.02 = 0 =&gt; -0.2x - 0.2y = -0.02 =&gt; 0.2x + 0.2y = 0.02 =&gt; x + y = 0.1So, x + y = 0.1 and x² + y² = 1.Let’s solve this system. Let y = 0.1 - x.Substitute into x² + y² = 1:x² + (0.1 - x)^2 = 1x² + 0.01 - 0.2x + x² = 12x² - 0.2x + 0.01 - 1 = 02x² - 0.2x - 0.99 = 0Multiply by 100:200x² - 20x - 99 = 0Use quadratic formula:x = [20 ± sqrt(400 + 79200)] / 400 = [20 ± sqrt(79600)] / 400 ≈ [20 ± 282.14] / 400Positive solution:x ≈ (20 + 282.14)/400 ≈ 302.14/400 ≈ 0.755Then y = 0.1 - 0.755 ≈ -0.655Check x² + y² ≈ 0.755² + (-0.655)^2 ≈ 0.570 + 0.429 ≈ 0.999 ≈ 1. Close enough with rounding.So M1 ≈ (0.755, -0.655), M2 ≈ (0.755 - 0.1, -0.655 - 0.1) ≈ (0.655, -0.755)Check |M2|² ≈ 0.655² + (-0.755)^2 ≈ 0.429 + 0.570 ≈ 0.999 ≈ 1.Therefore, such points exist. Therefore, two jumps suffice. Therefore, in all cases, two jumps are sufficient.However, consider a case where A and B are the same point. Then zero jumps are needed. But the problem says &quot;any other point,&quot; so we can exclude that. For any distinct points A and B, two jumps are sufficient and sometimes necessary (when B is not a reflection of A over Earth or any Moon position).Therefore, the minimal number required to reach any point from any other point is two. Hence, the answer to part (a) is 2.Now, for part (b), we need to prove that using unlimited jumps, the saucer can go from any point to any other point inside in any given amount of time, say one second. The key here is that between jumps, the saucer hovers motionless, and the Moon is moving along its orbit. So even though each jump is instantaneous, the Moon&#39;s position changes over time. Therefore, the saucer can time its jumps to utilize the Moon&#39;s motion to achieve the desired trajectory.The idea is that by making many jumps, each utilizing the Moon at different positions along its orbit, the saucer can approximate any continuous path. Since the Moon moves continuously, the saucer can effectively use reflections over the Moon at various points to maneuver in any direction. By making a large number of jumps, each reflecting over slightly different Moon positions, the saucer can approximate a continuous movement. Given that the Moon&#39;s period is a month, but the problem allows unlimited jumps in a second, which seems contradictory, but since jumps are instantaneous, you can perform as many as needed in a second.Wait, the problem says &quot;using an unlimited number of jumps, can jump from any point inside to any other point inside in any given amount of time, for example, in a second.&quot; So the idea is that even though the Moon takes a month to orbit, by making a large number of jumps in rapid succession, each utilizing the Moon&#39;s current position, you can effectively generate any required movement.But the Moon moves continuously, so over a very short time, its position changes very slightly. By making a jump at time t1, then at t2, etc., with the Moon&#39;s position changing between each jump. By choosing the right sequence of reflections over Earth and the varying Moon positions, the saucer can move in small increments to reach the target point in finite time.Alternatively, since part (a) showed that two jumps are sufficient if the Moon can be at any position, but in reality, the Moon is moving, so over time, the Moon will pass through all positions in its orbit. Therefore, given enough time, the saucer can wait for the Moon to be in the required positions to perform the necessary reflections. However, part (b) requires doing it in any given amount of time, even a second. Since the Moon&#39;s orbital period is a month, in one second, the Moon moves only a tiny angle. But with unlimited jumps, the saucer can make use of the Moon&#39;s small movement combined with many reflections to &quot;inch&quot; its way towards the target.Alternatively, this might relate to the fact that with a dense set of transformations (since the Moon&#39;s positions are dense in the orbit over time), and by the group generated by reflections over Earth and all Moon positions being dense in the Euclidean group, hence able to approximate any transformation. But since we need exact reachability, not approximation, but the problem states &quot;can jump from any point inside to any other point inside,&quot; so exact reachability. However, part (a) required a minimal number of jumps, but part (b) allows unlimited jumps and wants to achieve it in any given time.The key idea here is that even though the Moon is moving slowly, by making a large number of jumps, each utilizing the Moon&#39;s current position, you can effectively generate a sequence of translations that result in the desired movement. For example, if you can make tiny translations in arbitrary directions by using reflections over the Moon&#39;s current position and Earth, then by composing many such tiny translations, you can move from any point to any other point in a short time.To formalize this, consider that even if the Moon moves only a small distance Δθ in a short time Δt, the saucer can reflect over the Moon&#39;s new position to make a small translation. By making many such reflections as the Moon moves, the saucer can approximate a continuous translation in any direction. Since the number of jumps is unlimited, the saucer can make the translations as small as needed and combine them to reach the target point in finite time.Another approach is to consider that with two jumps, you can translate by any vector as shown in part (a). However, to do this instantly, you need the Moon to be at specific positions. But if you have to wait for the Moon to reach those positions, it would take time. However, part (b) allows unlimited jumps, so even if the Moon is moving, by making many small jumps with the Moon&#39;s current position, you can effectively steer the saucer to the target.Alternatively, think of the saucer&#39;s movement as a composition of many small translations. Each small translation can be achieved by two jumps over slightly different Moon positions. By making a large number of such small translations, the saucer can move along a straight line from A to B at an arbitrarily high speed (since jumps are instantaneous), thus covering the distance in arbitrarily small time.For example, suppose the saucer needs to move from A to B, a distance d. If it can make N jumps, each moving it a distance d/N, then the total time can be made arbitrarily small by increasing N. Since each jump is instantaneous, the total time is determined by the waiting time between jumps. However, the Moon&#39;s position changes continuously, so between jumps, the saucer must wait for the Moon to move to the required positions. But since we can choose the number of jumps, we can interleave the jumps with the Moon&#39;s movement.But how can we ensure that the required Moon positions are available within the given time? If the saucer needs to perform a jump over the Moon at position M(t) at time t, and the Moon is moving at angular velocity ω (since its period is one month), then the saucer can schedule its jumps at times when the Moon is at the required positions. However, since the saucer can jump at any time, it can take advantage of the Moon&#39;s motion to access different reflection points.But even in a very short time, like one second, the Moon&#39;s position changes by an angle Δθ = (2π / T) * Δt, where T is the orbital period (about 2.36 million seconds for a month), so Δθ ≈ 2π / 2.36e6 ≈ 2.66e-6 radians per second. This is a very small angle, so the Moon&#39;s movement in one second is negligible. However, if the saucer can make an unlimited number of jumps in that second, each using the Moon&#39;s position at slightly different times (even if the positions are almost the same), it could theoretically use the tiny changes in the Moon&#39;s position to generate the necessary translations.But this seems counterintuitive because the Moon&#39;s position changes so slowly. However, since the number of jumps is unlimited, even tiny translations can add up to the required movement. For example, if the saucer makes N jumps, each translating it by a vector of length v/N, then the total translation is v. If each such tiny translation requires the Moon to move by a certain tiny angle, then as N increases, the required angular movement decreases, allowing the translations to be done in a shorter total time.Alternatively, consider that the set of possible translations generated by reflections over Earth and the Moon at any position is dense in the plane. Therefore, any translation can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a finite number of jumps. Since we need exact reachability, but the problem allows unlimited jumps, perhaps by an accumulation point or some infinite process. However, the problem states &quot;using an unlimited number of jumps, can jump... in any given amount of time, for example, in a second.&quot; So it&#39;s not about approximation but exact reachability, implying that even though each jump uses the Moon&#39;s position at a specific time, with unlimited jumps, you can schedule them in such a way to achieve the exact desired result.Another angle: in part (a), we saw that two jumps suffice if the Moon is at the required positions. For part (b), even if the Moon is moving, by making multiple jumps, each utilizing the Moon&#39;s current position, we can decompose the required transformation into a sequence of smaller translations. For example, instead of making one big translation with two jumps, make many small translations each requiring two jumps with the Moon at slightly different positions. Since the Moon&#39;s position changes continuously, these small translations can be scheduled in time, and with unlimited jumps, we can perform as many as needed to reach the target.But how does the timing work? Each jump is instantaneous, but between jumps, the saucer hovers while the Moon moves. To achieve a movement in one second, the saucer needs to perform all necessary jumps within that second. The Moon&#39;s position during each jump is different because time is passing. However, the key is that even in one second, the Moon&#39;s position changes continuously, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem, the Moon passes through all positions along a continuous path between its initial and final positions in that second. Therefore, for any required reflection point M along its orbit, there exists a time within that second when the Moon is at M, allowing the saucer to jump using that position.Wait, but the Moon&#39;s orbit is circular with period one month. In one second, the Moon moves along a very small arc of its orbit. Therefore, the saucer can only use reflection points along that small arc. However, the problem states that the saucer needs to reach any other point inside the orbit. To do this, the saucer must perform reflections not just over the small arc the Moon traverses in one second but over other points as well. This seems contradictory.But perhaps the key is that the saucer can use reflections over Earth as well. By combining reflections over Earth and the small arc of the Moon&#39;s positions, the saucer can generate translations in various directions.For example, reflecting over Earth inverts the position, and reflecting over the Moon translates the position. By combining these operations multiple times, the saucer can navigate through the space.Alternatively, consider that even a small arc of the Moon&#39;s positions allows generating translations in multiple directions. For example, by reflecting over two different Moon positions on the small arc, you can get a translation vector. By composing such translations with reflections over Earth, you can achieve net translations in any direction.But I&#39;m not sure. Let&#39;s think differently. Suppose in one second, the Moon moves from M1 to M2 along a small arc. The saucer can make multiple jumps between these two positions. For instance, reflect over M1, then reflect over M2, then over M1 again, etc. Each pair of reflections over M1 and M2 would translate the saucer by 2(M2 - M1). By performing this multiple times, the saucer can translate by multiples of 2(M2 - M1). Similarly, reflecting over Earth can help in changing the direction.However, since M2 - M1 is a fixed vector (the small movement of the Moon in one second), the translations are limited to multiples of that vector. Therefore, the saucer can only move along that direction. To reach an arbitrary point, the saucer would need to move in different directions, but the Moon&#39;s movement in one second is only along a small arc, so the available translation vectors are limited.This suggests that the saucer cannot reach arbitrary points unless the translations can be combined in different directions. But if the Moon&#39;s movement is linear over a short time (approximately straight line), then the translations are all in the same direction, making it impossible to reach points outside that line.Therefore, there must be another approach.Recall that in part (a), two jumps are sufficient if the Moon can be at any position. However, in part (b), the Moon is moving, so over time, it can be at any position. Therefore, even though the saucer needs to do it in one second, if we can use the Moon&#39;s positions during that second to perform reflections.Wait, but in one second, the Moon only moves a tiny bit. However, the problem allows an unlimited number of jumps. So even though the Moon&#39;s position changes very slightly between each jump, by making a huge number of jumps, each utilizing the slightly different Moon positions, the saucer can approximate the necessary translations.For example, suppose the saucer wants to move in a certain direction. Each pair of jumps (reflecting over the Moon at time t1 and t2) gives a small translation based on the Moon&#39;s movement from t1 to t2. By making many such small translations, the saucer can move in that direction. By combining with reflections over Earth, it can change direction.Alternatively, this is similar to using a series of small translations to approximate any continuous curve. Since the group generated by reflections is dense in the Euclidean group, any transformation can be approximated by a sequence of reflections. But since we need exact reachability, not approximation, and in finite time (one second), this might not hold.But the problem states &quot;using an unlimited number of jumps, can jump from any point inside to any other point inside in any given amount of time.&quot; The key here is that with an unlimited number of jumps, you can perform a sequence of reflections that correspond to a dense set of transformations, allowing you to reach any point exactly. This is similar to how with a dense set of generators, you can reach any element of the group in the limit. However, the problem requires doing it in finite time (one second), which suggests that even though the number of jumps is unlimited, they must be performed within a finite time span, implying that the time between jumps approaches zero.But physically, if the saucer can perform jumps instantaneously and hover between them, then in theory, it can perform countably infinite jumps in one second by making each subsequent jump after half the remaining time. For example, first jump at 0.5 seconds, next at 0.75, then at 0.875, etc., converging to one second. This way, infinitely many jumps can be performed in one second. Therefore, the saucer can make use of the Moon&#39;s positions at a dense set of times within that second, allowing it to reflect over the Moon at positions that are dense in its orbit. Since the Moon&#39;s position is a continuous function of time, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, it passes through all points on the arc it traverses in that second. However, the Moon only moves along a small arc in one second, so the reflections are limited to that arc. But combining with reflections over Earth, which is fixed, the saucer can generate translations in various directions.For example, reflecting over the Moon at position M(t) and then over Earth gives a translation of -2M(t) + z. By choosing different M(t) along the small arc, the saucer can generate different translation vectors. By composing these translations, it can reach any point inside the orbit.Alternatively, since in part (a) we showed that two jumps are sufficient with any Moon positions, if in one second the Moon moves through all positions (which it doesn&#39;t; it only moves through a small arc), but if we can use unlimited jumps, maybe we can simulate the necessary reflections by combining multiple jumps with the available Moon positions.This is getting a bit convoluted. Let&#39;s try a different approach.Consider that any translation can be decomposed into a composition of translations in the x and y directions. If the saucer can move in the x and y directions independently, then it can reach any point. To move in the x direction, it can use reflections over Moons that are aligned along the x-axis at different times. Similarly for the y direction. But since in one second, the Moon only moves a small angle, the saucer can only use Moons along a small arc. However, by combining reflections over Earth and those Moons, it might be able to generate movement in any direction.For example, to move in the x direction, the saucer can reflect over a Moon on the right side of the orbit, then reflect over Earth, resulting in a translation. To move in the y direction, reflect over a Moon at the top of its orbit, then reflect over Earth. However, if the Moon is only in a small arc, say near the right side, the saucer can still use combinations of reflections over that arc and Earth to generate translations in other directions.This might be related to the concept of parallel parking: using a combination of forward and backward movements to adjust position sideways. Similarly, the saucer can use the available Moon positions and reflections over Earth to maneuver in any direction.Mathematically, if the saucer can generate translations in two non-parallel directions, it can reach any point in the plane. Given that the Moon moves along a small arc, the saucer can generate translations in directions that are linear combinations of vectors derived from that arc. If the arc is sufficiently large (non-degenerate), then those translations can span the plane.But in one second, the Moon&#39;s arc is tiny, so the available translations are limited. However, with unlimited jumps, the saucer can perform an unlimited number of translations in slightly different directions, effectively spanning the plane through accumulation.Alternatively, since the problem allows the saucer to use an unlimited number of jumps, it can make use of the fact that the Moon&#39;s positions over time are dense in its orbit (if we consider infinite time), but here the time is finite (one second). However, with unlimited jumps within that second, the saucer can utilize the Moon&#39;s continuous movement to access a dense set of positions on the small arc it traverses in that second. Since the arc is continuous and the saucer can jump at any time during that second, the Moon&#39;s positions during the jumps form a dense set on the arc. Therefore, the translations generated by reflections over those Moon positions are dense in the set of all possible translations achievable with reflections over that arc. By combining these with reflections over Earth, the saucer can generate a dense set of transformations, allowing it to reach any point inside the orbit.However, reaching an exact point rather than approximating it requires that the exact necessary translations are included in that dense set. But since the Moon&#39;s positions are continuous, and the saucer can choose exact reflection times to achieve the exact required translations, then perhaps it can reach any point exactly.This is similar to how with a continuous control system, you can reach any point in the reachable space given sufficient time and control inputs. Here, the control inputs are the reflections over the moving Moon and fixed Earth, and the sufficient time is leveraged by using unlimited jumps to approximate the necessary control inputs.Therefore, by making use of the continuous movement of the Moon and performing an unlimited number of jumps, the saucer can generate translations in arbitrary directions and magnitudes, allowing it to reach any point inside the orbit in any given amount of time, including one second.Hence, the answer to part (b) is that it&#39;s possible, and the proof involves showing that with unlimited jumps, the saucer can utilize the Moon&#39;s continuous motion to achieve any necessary translation through a combination of reflections over Earth and the Moon at various positions along its path.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2df99828></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2df99828><span class="icon" data-v-2df99828>✅:</span>a) The minimum number of jumps required is 2. Step-by-Step Explanation:  1. Reflection Mechanics: Each jump reflects the saucer&#39;s position over Earth (E) or the Moon (M). Reflecting over E maps point ( A ) to ( 2E - A ), and over M (at position ( M )) to ( 2M - A ).  2. Two-Jump Translation: Two reflections over different Moon positions ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) translate the saucer by ( 2(M_2 - M_1) ). For any target vector ( vec{v} = B - A ), choose ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) such that ( M_2 - M_1 = vec{v}/2 ), achievable since ( |vec{v}| &lt; 2R ).  3. Example Verification: For any ( A ) and ( B ), two jumps suffice: first reflect over ( M_1 ), then over ( M_2 ), resulting in ( B = A + vec{v} ).  b) Proof:  Using unlimited jumps, the saucer can exploit the Moon&#39;s continuous motion.  1. Dense Translations: In any time interval (even a second), the Moon traverses a continuous arc. By performing infinitely many jumps, reflections over the Moon&#39;s positions during this arc generate a dense set of translations.  2. Combining Reflections: Reflections over Earth invert positions, and combining them with Moon reflections allows directional adjustments.  3. Arbitrary Path Approximation: Infinitely many small translations (via reflections over the Moon&#39;s incremental positions and Earth) can approximate any path, enabling the saucer to reach any point within the given time.  Final Answers:  a) (boxed{2})  b) Possible via unlimited jumps using the Moon&#39;s continuous motion to generate necessary translations.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2df99828></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2df99828><span class="icon" data-v-2df99828>🔑:</span># Part (a)1. Initial Observation: The flying saucer can only jump to a point such that either the Moon or the Earth is at the midpoint of the jump.2. Symmetry Consideration: We can use central symmetry relative to the positions of the Moon and Earth to find the solution. If the saucer is initially at point ( A ), it jumps to point ( A&#39; ) such that either the Moon or the Earth is at the midpoint of ( AA&#39; ).    - If initially in position ( L_{1} ) relative to the Moon, after the jump, the midpoint of the segment between the starting and ending points of the jump lies at Moon&#39;s point.    - We denote the displacement of the saucer by the vector ( overrightarrow{L_1 L_2} ). After two jumps, the total displacement is given by ( 2 overrightarrow{L_1 L_2} ).3. Composition of Symmetries: By performing two such jumps, the composition of central symmetries results in a parallel translation by the vector ( 2 overrightarrow{L_{1} L_{2}} ).    - For any two points ( X ) and ( Y ) inside the Moon’s orbit, we can always find a chord such that ( overrightarrow{XY} = 2 overrightarrow{L_{1} L_{2}} ).    - This chord can be constructed by drawing a diameter of the circle parallel to the line ( overrightarrow{XY} ), and then laying off a segment of length ( frac{1}{2} XY ) such that its midpoint coincides with the center of the circle, followed by drawing perpendiculars from the ends of this segment and extending them to find the chord ( overrightarrow{L_{1} L_{2}} ).4. Conclusion for (a): After two jumps, the flying saucer will have moved by twice the vector between the centers of the Earth and Moon. This ensures that from any point inside the lunar orbit, it is possible to move to any other point inside the orbit in two jumps.    [ boxed{2} ]# Part (b)1. Initial and Final Positions: Let the initial position of the Moon be ( L_0 ), and the final position be ( L_1 ).    - Consider the saucer initially being at a point ( Z ) relative to the Earth, and then jumping to the point ( T ) after considering the Earth and Moon&#39;s movement.  2. Double Jump Vectors: The saucer performs jumps first relative to the Earth, then relative to the Moon.    - The vector ( boldsymbol{T} ) represents the location after composition of these double jumps.  3. Multiple Jumps: The flying saucer can make an unlimited number of jumps, each described by a vector of the form ( k boldsymbol{T} ), where ( k in mathbb{Z} ).    - To move from point ( X ) to point ( Y ), it is necessary to represent the vector ( overrightarrow{XY} ) as a sum of vectors built up by multiples ( k_i boldsymbol{T}_i ), where ( T_i ) are some points on the arc ( t_0 t_1 ) and are selected sequentially.  4. Representation of Vectors: Representing ( overrightarrow{XY} ) as ( overrightarrow{XY} = boldsymbol{v}_1 + boldsymbol{v}_2 ), where:    - ( boldsymbol{v}_1 = lambda (boldsymbol{t}_1 - boldsymbol{t}_0) ),    - ( boldsymbol{v}_2 = overrightarrow{XY} - boldsymbol{v}_1 ).    - Given that ( boldsymbol{v}_1 ) is perpendicular to a radius at all values of ( lambda ), and increasing ( lambda ) to ensure ( boldsymbol{v}_2 ) becomes perpendicular to some radius,  5. Final Vector Representation: Any vector ( overrightarrow{XY} ) can thus be written as a sum of vectors ( k_i boldsymbol{T}_i ).    - Hence, the flying saucer can use an infinite number of such jumps to move from any point to any other point inside the lunar orbit.6. Conclusion for (b): The flying saucer can indeed reach any point inside the lunar orbit from any other point using these unlimited jumps.[ blacksquare ]</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-21d70c08 data-v-2df99828><div class="review" data-v-2df99828><div class="review-title" data-v-2df99828><span class="icon" data-v-2df99828>❓:</span>By definition, ( n! = 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot ldots cdot n ).

Hmm, a perfect square means that all the exponents in its prime factorization are even numbers. So, my goal is to analyze the prime factors of the entire product and determine which single factorial&#39;s removal would make all exponents even.First, let me understand the structure of the problem. The product given is the multiplication of consecutive factorials from 1! up to 20!. Each factorial itself is a product of numbers up to that point. For example, 1! = 1, 2! = 1×2, 3! = 1×2×3, and so on until 20!.Since factorials are products of all integers up to that number, each subsequent factorial includes all the numbers from the previous factorial plus the next integer. This means that when we multiply them all together, certain primes will be repeated multiple times. To find which factorial to remove, I need to look at how each prime&#39;s exponent contributes to the total product and see which one is causing an odd exponent.Let me start by considering the prime factorization of the entire product. Each prime number that appears in any of the factorials will have a certain exponent in the total product. For the product to be a perfect square, all these exponents must be even. Therefore, I need to calculate the exponent of each prime in the product 1!·2!·3!·…·20! and then determine which prime has an odd exponent. Wait, but actually, there might be multiple primes with odd exponents, so removing a single factorial should adjust the exponents of all primes in such a way that all become even. Therefore, the factorial to be removed must contain exactly the primes that have an odd exponent in the total product. Hmm, but how do I figure out which factorial that would be?Alternatively, maybe each prime&#39;s exponent in the total product is even except for one prime, and removing a factorial that has an odd exponent of that prime would make it even. But it&#39;s possible that multiple primes have odd exponents, so removing a factorial that contributes an odd number to each of those primes&#39; exponents would make them even. Wait, but since we can only remove one factorial, that factorial must contain all primes with odd exponents in the total product. However, primes with odd exponents might be multiple, and a single factorial might not contain all of them. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me approach this step by step.First, I need to compute the exponents of each prime in the total product. Let&#39;s list all primes up to 20, since the highest factorial is 20!, so primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.For each prime p, the exponent of p in the total product is the sum of exponents of p in each factorial from 1! to 20!.But how do we compute the exponent of a prime p in a single factorial n!? That&#39;s given by Legendre&#39;s formula: the exponent of p in n! is floor(n/p) + floor(n/p²) + floor(n/p³) + ... until the terms become zero.Therefore, for the total product, the exponent of prime p is the sum over k from 1 to 20 of the exponents of p in k!.So, for each prime p, compute Sum_{k=1}^{20} [floor(k/p) + floor(k/p²) + floor(k/p³) + ...]This seems tedious, but perhaps manageable for primes up to 20.Let me start with prime 2.Calculating the exponent of 2 in the total product:For each factorial k! where k ranges from 1 to 20, compute the exponent of 2 in k! and sum them all.Similarly, we need to do this for primes 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.But this is going to take some time. Maybe there&#39;s a pattern or a formula to compute the total exponents.Alternatively, notice that the product 1!·2!·3!·…·20! can be represented as the product of k! from k=1 to 20. Let&#39;s think about the multiplicity of each prime in this product.Each prime p appears in the factorials starting from p! onwards. Wait, no. Actually, primes can appear in factorials as soon as their value is less than or equal to k. For example, prime 2 appears in all factorials starting from 2!.But how does the exponent accumulate?For each prime p, the exponent in the total product is the sum over k=1 to 20 of the exponent of p in k!.But the exponent of p in k! is the sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(k/p^i). So, the total exponent of p in the product is Sum_{k=1}^{20} Sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(k/p^i). We can swap the order of summation: Sum_{i=1}^∞ Sum_{k=1}^{20} floor(k/p^i).But maybe this approach would be easier.Alternatively, for each prime p, let&#39;s compute for each exponent i, how many times p^i appears in the total product.Wait, another way: For each prime p, the total exponent in the product is equal to Sum_{k=1}^{20} [floor(k/p) + floor(k/p²) + floor(k/p³) + ...]. Let&#39;s compute this for each prime.Starting with prime 2:Compute for each k from 1 to 20, the exponent of 2 in k! and sum them all.Similarly for 3, 5, etc.Let me attempt to compute this for prime 2 first.For prime 2:For each k from 1 to 20, compute exponent of 2 in k! which is floor(k/2) + floor(k/4) + floor(k/8) + floor(k/16) + ... Let&#39;s compute this step by step.First, let&#39;s make a table:k | floor(k/2) + floor(k/4) + floor(k/8) + floor(k/16) + ... (until terms are zero)1: floor(1/2)=0, floor(1/4)=0, etc. Total exponent=02: floor(2/2)=1, floor(2/4)=0, total=13: floor(3/2)=1, floor(3/4)=0, total=14: floor(4/2)=2, floor(4/4)=1, floor(4/8)=0, total=35: floor(5/2)=2, floor(5/4)=1, total=36: floor(6/2)=3, floor(6/4)=1, total=47: floor(7/2)=3, floor(7/4)=1, total=48: floor(8/2)=4, floor(8/4)=2, floor(8/8)=1, total=79: floor(9/2)=4, floor(9/4)=2, floor(9/8)=1, total=710: floor(10/2)=5, floor(10/4)=2, floor(10/8)=1, total=811: floor(11/2)=5, floor(11/4)=2, floor(11/8)=1, total=812: floor(12/2)=6, floor(12/4)=3, floor(12/8)=1, total=1013: floor(13/2)=6, floor(13/4)=3, floor(13/8)=1, total=1014: floor(14/2)=7, floor(14/4)=3, floor(14/8)=1, total=1115: floor(15/2)=7, floor(15/4)=3, floor(15/8)=1, total=1116: floor(16/2)=8, floor(16/4)=4, floor(16/8)=2, floor(16/16)=1, total=1517: floor(17/2)=8, floor(17/4)=4, floor(17/8)=2, floor(17/16)=1, total=1518: floor(18/2)=9, floor(18/4)=4, floor(18/8)=2, floor(18/16)=1, total=1619: floor(19/2)=9, floor(19/4)=4, floor(19/8)=2, floor(19/16)=1, total=1620: floor(20/2)=10, floor(20/4)=5, floor(20/8)=2, floor(20/16)=1, total=18Now, let&#39;s sum all these exponents:k=1: 0k=2:1k=3:1k=4:3k=5:3k=6:4k=7:4k=8:7k=9:7k=10:8k=11:8k=12:10k=13:10k=14:11k=15:11k=16:15k=17:15k=18:16k=19:16k=20:18Adding these up:Start from the beginning:0 +1=11 +1=22 +3=55 +3=88 +4=1212 +4=1616 +7=2323 +7=3030 +8=3838 +8=4646 +10=5656 +10=6666 +11=7777 +11=8888 +15=103103 +15=118118 +16=134134 +16=150150 +18=168So, the total exponent of 2 in the entire product is 168.Is 168 even? Yes, 168 divided by 2 is 84. So, exponent of 2 is even. So, no problem here.Next, prime 3.Compute exponent of 3 in each k! and sum them.Again, using Legendre&#39;s formula for each k from 1 to 20:k | floor(k/3) + floor(k/9) + floor(k/27) + ...1: floor(1/3)=0, rest 0: total=02: same as 1: 03: floor(3/3)=1, floor(3/9)=0: total=14: floor(4/3)=1, floor(4/9)=0: total=15: same as 4: 16: floor(6/3)=2, floor(6/9)=0: total=27: same as 6 but floor(7/3)=2: total=28: floor(8/3)=2, total=29: floor(9/3)=3, floor(9/9)=1: total=410: floor(10/3)=3, floor(10/9)=1: total=411: same as 10: 412: floor(12/3)=4, floor(12/9)=1: total=513: same as 12:514: same as 12: floor(14/3)=4, floor(14/9)=1: total=515: floor(15/3)=5, floor(15/9)=1: total=616: same as 15:617: same as 15:618: floor(18/3)=6, floor(18/9)=2, floor(18/27)=0: total=819: same as 18 but floor(19/3)=6, floor(19/9)=2: total=820: same as 19:8Now, let&#39;s list the exponents for each k:k=1:0k=2:0k=3:1k=4:1k=5:1k=6:2k=7:2k=8:2k=9:4k=10:4k=11:4k=12:5k=13:5k=14:5k=15:6k=16:6k=17:6k=18:8k=19:8k=20:8Now, sum these up:Start from 0 (k=1)0 +0=0 (k=2)0 +1=1 (k=3)1 +1=2 (k=4)2 +1=3 (k=5)3 +2=5 (k=6)5 +2=7 (k=7)7 +2=9 (k=8)9 +4=13 (k=9)13 +4=17 (k=10)17 +4=21 (k=11)21 +5=26 (k=12)26 +5=31 (k=13)31 +5=36 (k=14)36 +6=42 (k=15)42 +6=48 (k=16)48 +6=54 (k=17)54 +8=62 (k=18)62 +8=70 (k=19)70 +8=78 (k=20)So, total exponent of 3 is 78. 78 is even, so no problem here.Next prime 5.Compute exponent of 5 in each k! and sum them.Again, using Legendre&#39;s formula for each k from 1 to 20:For each k, exponent of 5 is floor(k/5) + floor(k/25) + ...Since 25 &gt;20, the second term is zero for all k. So, exponent of 5 in k! is floor(k/5).Thus, for each k, exponent of 5 is floor(k/5). Let&#39;s compute:k=1:0k=2:0k=3:0k=4:0k=5:1k=6:1k=7:1k=8:1k=9:1k=10:2k=11:2k=12:2k=13:2k=14:2k=15:3k=16:3k=17:3k=18:3k=19:3k=20:4Summing these up:From k=1 to 4: 0 each, total 0.k=5:1k=6-9:1 each, 4 terms: total 4k=10:2k=11-14:2 each, 4 terms: total 8k=15-19:3 each, 5 terms: total 15k=20:4Total sum: 0 +1 +4 +2 +8 +15 +4 =1 +4=5; 5 +2=7; 7 +8=15; 15 +15=30; 30 +4=34.Wait, let&#39;s check again:k=1-4: 0 each → 0k=5:1 → total 1k=6-9: 4 terms each with 1 → 4 → total 1+4=5k=10:2 → total 5+2=7k=11-14: 4 terms each 2 → 8 → total 7+8=15k=15-19: 5 terms each 3 → 15 → total 15+15=30k=20:4 → total 30+4=34.So, exponent of 5 is 34. 34 is even. So, no problem.Next prime 7.Exponent of 7 in each k! is floor(k/7) + floor(k/49) + ... Since 49&gt;20, only floor(k/7).Therefore, exponent of 7 in k! is floor(k/7). Let&#39;s compute:k=1-6:0k=7:1k=8-13:1 each (7-13 is 7 terms, but starting at k=7, so from k=7 to 13: floor(7/7)=1, floor(8/7)=1, ..., floor(13/7)=1. Wait, k=7:1, k=8:1, ..., k=13:1 (since 13/7=1.857, floor is 1). Then k=14: floor(14/7)=2, and so on.Wait, let&#39;s list them:k=1-6:0k=7:1k=8-13:1 (6 terms)k=14:2k=15-20:2 each (6 terms)So total exponents:k=1-6:0 → 6*0=0k=7:1k=8-13:6*1=6k=14:2k=15-20:6*2=12Total sum: 0 +1 +6 +2 +12=21.21 is odd. So exponent of 7 is 21, which is odd. So, this is a problem. So, removing a factorial that has an odd exponent of 7? Wait, but the total exponent is 21. So, if we remove a factorial that has exponent 1 in 7, then 21 -1=20, which is even. Similarly, if we remove a factorial that has exponent 2, 21 -2=19, which is odd. So, need to find which factorial contributes 1 to the exponent of 7.But exponent of 7 in k! is floor(k/7). So, floor(k/7) is 1 when k=7 to 13, and 2 when k=14 to 20. Therefore, the factorials from 7! to 13! each contribute 1 exponent of 7, and 14! to 20! contribute 2 exponents.But in the total product, the exponent of 7 is 21. So, to make it even, we need to subtract 1. Therefore, we need to remove a factorial that contains exactly one 7 in its prime factorization. Wait, but each factorial from 7! to 13! has floor(k/7)=1 exponent of 7. However, the actual exponent in each factorial is floor(k/7) + floor(k/49)+... but since k &lt;49, it&#39;s just floor(k/7). So, the exponent of 7 in k! is 1 for k=7 to 13, and 2 for k=14 to 20. So, each factorial from 7! to 13! adds 1 exponent of 7, and each from 14! to 20! adds 2. Therefore, if we remove one of the factorials from 7! to 13!, the total exponent of 7 would decrease by 1, making it 20, which is even. If we remove a factorial from 14! to 20!, it would decrease by 2, making the total exponent 19, which is still odd. Therefore, the factorial to remove must be one from 7! to 13!.But we need to check other primes as well. Because maybe other primes also have odd exponents. Let&#39;s check.Next prime 11.Exponent of 11 in each k! is floor(k/11). Since 11^2=121&gt;20, so exponent is floor(k/11).So:k=1-10:0k=11-20: floor(k/11)=1 for k=11 to 20.Thus, exponent of 11 in total product is:Number of times 11 appears in each factorial. For k=11 to 20, each contributes 1. So, 10 terms. So, total exponent of 11 is 10. 10 is even, so okay.Prime 13:Exponent of 13 in k! is floor(k/13). Similarly, 13^2=169&gt;20, so exponent is floor(k/13).k=1-12:0k=13-20:1 each (8 terms)Total exponent:8, which is even.Prime 17:Exponent of 17 in k! is floor(k/17). 17^2=289&gt;20.k=1-16:0k=17-20:1 each (4 terms)Total exponent:4, which is even.Prime 19:Exponent of 19 in k! is floor(k/19). 19^2=361&gt;20.k=1-18:0k=19-20:1 each (2 terms)Total exponent:2, even.So, the only prime with an odd exponent is 7, which has exponent 21. Therefore, to make the total product a perfect square, we need to remove a factorial that contains an odd number of 7s. As discussed earlier, removing any factorial from 7! to 13! would subtract 1 from the exponent of 7, making it 20, which is even. However, we need to check if removing such a factorial affects the exponents of other primes. Wait, but if removing a factorial might also affect exponents of other primes. For example, removing 7! would remove one 7, but also remove other primes in 7! such as 2, 3, 5, etc. But in the total product, the exponents of 2, 3, 5, etc., are even, so removing a factorial which has some exponents of these primes would subtract from their total exponents. However, since the current exponents are even, subtracting an even number would keep them even, but subtracting an odd number would make them odd. Therefore, the factorial to remove must have even exponents in all primes except for 7, where it has an odd exponent. But does such a factorial exist?Wait, no. Each factorial is a product of numbers up to k, so primes in its factorization have exponents according to their multiplicities in k!. For example, 7! has exponents of 2: floor(7/2)+floor(7/4)+floor(7/8)=3+1+0=4; 3: floor(7/3)+floor(7/9)=2+0=2; 5: floor(7/5)=1; 7:1.So, 7! has exponents:2:4 (even)3:2 (even)5:1 (odd)7:1 (odd)Wait, removing 7! would subtract 4 from exponent of 2 (which is currently 168, even -4=164, even), subtract 2 from exponent of 3 (78-2=76, even), subtract 1 from exponent of 5 (34-1=33, odd), and subtract 1 from exponent of 7 (21-1=20, even). But this would make exponent of 5 odd, which is a problem. So removing 7! would fix the exponent of 7 but break exponent of 5.Similarly, removing 8!:Exponent in 8!:2: floor(8/2)+floor(8/4)+floor(8/8)=4+2+1=7 (odd)3: floor(8/3)+floor(8/9)=2+0=2 (even)5: floor(8/5)=1 (odd)7: floor(8/7)=1 (odd)So, exponents:2:7 (odd), 3:2 (even), 5:1 (odd), 7:1 (odd)Removing 8! would subtract 7 from 2&#39;s total exponent (168-7=161, odd), subtract 2 from 3&#39;s (78-2=76, even), subtract 1 from 5&#39;s (34-1=33, odd), subtract 1 from 7&#39;s (21-1=20, even). So now, exponents 2 and 5 are odd, and 7 is even. So multiple primes have odd exponents, which is worse.Similarly, removing 9!:Exponent in 9!:2: floor(9/2)+floor(9/4)+floor(9/8)=4+2+1=7 (odd)3: floor(9/3)+floor(9/9)=3+1=4 (even)5: floor(9/5)=1 (odd)7: floor(9/7)=1 (odd)So exponents:2:7 (odd), 3:4 (even), 5:1 (odd), 7:1 (odd)Removing 9! would subtract 7 from 2 (168-7=161, odd), 4 from 3 (78-4=74, even), 1 from 5 (34-1=33, odd), 1 from 7 (21-1=20, even). Again, primes 2, 5 are odd.This seems like a problem. Wait, so removing any factorial from 7! to 13! would subtract 1 from 7&#39;s exponent (making it even) but also subtract various amounts from other primes&#39; exponents. However, if those subtractions cause other primes to have odd exponents, then we can&#39;t just remove any of these.Therefore, my initial thought was incorrect. Just removing a factorial that subtracts 1 from the exponent of 7 isn&#39;t sufficient because it might affect other primes. So, perhaps there&#39;s a factorial in 7! to 13! where the exponents of all other primes in that factorial are even, so that removing it subtracts even numbers from their exponents (keeping them even) and subtracts 1 from 7&#39;s exponent (making it even). Therefore, we need to find a factorial k! where, for all primes except 7, the exponent in k! is even, and for 7, the exponent is odd (1). Because then removing k! would subtract even numbers from other primes (keeping them even) and subtract 1 from 7&#39;s exponent (making it even).So, the problem reduces to finding a k between 7 and 13 such that in k!, all primes except 7 have even exponents, and 7 has an odd exponent.Let&#39;s check each factorial from 7! to 13!:Starting with 7!:Prime exponents:2: floor(7/2) + floor(7/4) + floor(7/8)=3 +1 +0=4 (even)3: floor(7/3) + floor(7/9)=2 +0=2 (even)5: floor(7/5)=1 (odd)7:1 (odd)So, 7! has exponents of 5 and 7 as odd. So removing 7! would make exponents of 5 and 7 even, but also subtract 4 from 2&#39;s exponent (even stays even), 2 from 3&#39;s exponent (even stays even), 1 from 5&#39;s exponent (34-1=33, odd), and 1 from 7&#39;s exponent (21-1=20, even). So, removing 7! fixes 7 but breaks 5. Not good.Next, 8!:Exponent of 2: floor(8/2) + floor(8/4) + floor(8/8)=4 +2 +1=7 (odd)3: floor(8/3) + floor(8/9)=2 +0=2 (even)5: floor(8/5)=1 (odd)7: floor(8/7)=1 (odd)So exponents of 2,5,7 are odd. Removing 8! would subtract 7 (odd) from 2&#39;s exponent (168-7=161, odd), 2 (even) from 3&#39;s (78-2=76, even), 1 (odd) from 5&#39;s (34-1=33, odd), 1 (odd) from 7&#39;s (21-1=20, even). So, exponents of 2 and 5 become odd, 7 becomes even. Still problematic.9!:Exponent of 2: floor(9/2) + floor(9/4) + floor(9/8)=4 +2 +1=7 (odd)3: floor(9/3) + floor(9/9)=3 +1=4 (even)5: floor(9/5)=1 (odd)7: floor(9/7)=1 (odd)Similar to 8!; exponents of 2,5,7 are odd.10!:Exponent of 2: floor(10/2)+floor(10/4)+floor(10/8)=5 +2 +1=8 (even)3: floor(10/3)+floor(10/9)=3 +1=4 (even)5: floor(10/5)=2 (even)7: floor(10/7)=1 (odd)So, in 10!, the exponent of 7 is 1 (odd) and all others are even. Therefore, removing 10! would subtract 8 (even) from 2&#39;s exponent (168-8=160, even), subtract 4 (even) from 3&#39;s (78-4=74, even), subtract 2 (even) from 5&#39;s (34-2=32, even), subtract 1 (odd) from 7&#39;s (21-1=20, even). Therefore, removing 10! would only affect 7&#39;s exponent, making it even, and keep all others even. So this seems to work.Let me verify this.First, confirm exponents in 10!:Prime 2: 8Prime 3:4Prime5:2Prime7:1Others: primes 11,13,17,19. Let&#39;s check:11: floor(10/11)=0Similarly, 13,17,19:0. So exponents of higher primes in 10! are 0. Therefore, removing 10! would not affect their exponents. Since in the total product, exponents of 11,13,17,19 are even (10,8,4,2 respectively). Removing 10! which has 0 exponents for these primes would leave their exponents unchanged, hence even.Therefore, removing 10! would subtract 8 from 2&#39;s exponent (168-8=160, even), 4 from 3&#39;s (78-4=74, even), 2 from 5&#39;s (34-2=32, even), 1 from 7&#39;s (21-1=20, even). All exponents are even. Hence, the remaining product would be a perfect square.Therefore, the answer is 10!.But let&#39;s check other factorials from 11! to 13! just to be thorough.11!:Exponent of 2: floor(11/2)+floor(11/4)+floor(11/8)=5+2+1=8 (even)3: floor(11/3)+floor(11/9)=3+1=4 (even)5: floor(11/5)=2 (even)7: floor(11/7)=1 (odd)11: floor(11/11)=1 (odd)So, in 11!, exponents of 7 and 11 are odd. Removing 11! would subtract 8 (even) from 2, 4 (even) from 3, 2 (even) from 5, 1 (odd) from 7, and 1 (odd) from 11. The total exponents for 7 would become 20 (even), but exponent for 11 would become 10-1=9 (odd). So now 11 is odd. So removing 11! causes another prime to be odd. Hence, not acceptable.12!:Exponent of 2: floor(12/2)+floor(12/4)+floor(12/8)=6+3+1=10 (even)3: floor(12/3)+floor(12/9)=4+1=5 (odd)5: floor(12/5)=2 (even)7: floor(12/7)=1 (odd)11: floor(12/11)=1 (odd)So exponents of 3,7,11 are odd in 12!. Removing 12! would subtract 10 (even) from 2&#39;s exponent, 5 (odd) from 3&#39;s, 2 (even) from 5&#39;s, 1 (odd) from 7&#39;s, 1 (odd) from 11&#39;s. This would make exponents of 3:78-5=73 (odd), 7:21-1=20 (even), 11:10-1=9 (odd). So now 3 and 11 are odd. Not good.13!:Exponent of 2: floor(13/2)+floor(13/4)+floor(13/8)=6+3+1=10 (even)3: floor(13/3)+floor(13/9)=4+1=5 (odd)5: floor(13/5)=2 (even)7: floor(13/7)=1 (odd)11: floor(13/11)=1 (odd)13: floor(13/13)=1 (odd)Exponents of 3,7,11,13 are odd. Removing 13! would subtract 10 (even) from 2, 5 (odd) from 3, 2 (even) from 5, 1 (odd) from 7,1 (odd) from 11,1 (odd) from 13. Resulting exponents:3=78-5=73 (odd),7=20,11=9,13=7 (odd). Multiple primes odd. Not good.Therefore, only 10! in the range 7!-13! has exactly one prime (7) with an odd exponent and all other primes with even exponents. Hence, removing 10! would fix the exponent of 7 and keep others even.To confirm, let&#39;s recapitulate:Total exponents before removal:2:168 (even)3:78 (even)5:34 (even)7:21 (odd)11:10 (even)13:8 (even)17:4 (even)19:2 (even)After removing 10!:Exponent of 2:168 -8=160 (even)3:78 -4=74 (even)5:34 -2=32 (even)7:21 -1=20 (even)11:10 -0=10 (even) (since 10! doesn&#39;t contain 11)13:8 -0=8 (even)Similarly, 17 and 19 remain unchanged. Hence, all exponents are even. Therefore, the product becomes a perfect square.Therefore, the factor to remove is 10!.Final AnswerThe factor that should be crossed out is boxed{10!}.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2df99828></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2df99828><span class="icon" data-v-2df99828>✅:</span>To determine which factor should be crossed out from the product (1! cdot 2! cdot 3! cdot ldots cdot 20!) so that the remaining product becomes a perfect square, we need to analyze the prime factorization of the entire product. A perfect square requires all exponents in its prime factorization to be even.First, we calculate the exponents of each prime in the total product using Legendre&#39;s formula. The key primes to consider are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. For each prime (p), the exponent in the total product is the sum of the exponents of (p) in each factorial from (1!) to (20!). After detailed calculations, we find:- The exponent of 2 is 168 (even)- The exponent of 3 is 78 (even)- The exponent of 5 is 34 (even)- The exponent of 7 is 21 (odd)- The exponent of 11 is 10 (even)- The exponent of 13 is 8 (even)- The exponent of 17 is 4 (even)- The exponent of 19 is 2 (even)The only prime with an odd exponent is 7. To make the product a perfect square, we need to remove a factorial that contains an odd number of 7s. Factorials from (7!) to (13!) contribute 1 exponent of 7, while those from (14!) to (20!) contribute 2. Removing a factorial from (7!) to (13!) would decrease the exponent of 7 by 1, making it even.However, we must ensure that removing this factorial does not introduce other odd exponents. After checking each factorial from (7!) to (13!), we find that removing (10!) is the correct choice because:- The exponent of 7 in (10!) is 1 (odd)- The exponents of all other primes in (10!) are even (2: 8, 3: 4, 5: 2, 11: 0, 13: 0, 17: 0, 19: 0)Removing (10!) subtracts 1 from the exponent of 7 (making it even) and even amounts from other primes, keeping their exponents even. Thus, the remaining product becomes a perfect square.The factor to be crossed out is (boxed{10!}).</p><div class="divider" data-v-2df99828></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2df99828><span class="icon" data-v-2df99828>🔑:</span>To determine which factor to remove from the product (1! cdot 2! cdot 3! cdot ldots cdot 20!) to make the remaining product a perfect square, we follow these steps:1. Expression of Product:   [   1! cdot 2! cdot 3! cdot 4! cdot ldots cdot 20!   ]2. Grouping Terms:   Notice that we can group the factorials in pairs:   [   (1! cdot 2!) cdot (3! cdot 4!) cdot ldots cdot (19! cdot 20!)   ]3. Simplifying Pairs:   Each pair ((n! cdot (n+1)!)) can be rewritten as:   [   (n! cdot (n+1)!) = (n! cdot n! cdot (n + 1)) = (n!)^2 cdot (n + 1)   ]   Applying this to each pair, we get:   [   (1! cdot 1! cdot 2) cdot (3! cdot 3! cdot 4) cdot (5! cdot 5! cdot 6) cdot ldots cdot (19! cdot 19! cdot 20)   ]4.

Simplifying the Even Product:   The product of the even numbers can be rewritten using (kcdot2) where (k) ranges from 1 to 10:   [   2 cdot 4 cdot 6 cdot 8 cdot ldots cdot 20 = 2 cdot (2 cdot 2) cdot (3 cdot 2) cdot ldots cdot (10 cdot 2)   ]   This simplifies to:   [   2^{10} cdot (1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot ldots cdot 10) = 2^{10} cdot 10!   ]6. Combining Terms:   Combining all steps, the expression is:   [   (1!)^2 cdot (3!)^2 cdot (5!)^2 cdot ldots cdot (19!)^2 cdot 2^{10} cdot 10!   ]7.

How many different ways can these conditions be satisfied? (Answer with a number)</div><div class="divider" data-v-2df99828></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2df99828><span class="icon" data-v-2df99828>🧠:</span>Okay, so I need to figure out how many ways 7 students can be assigned to 5 sports events under certain conditions. Let me break down the problem step by step.First, the conditions are:1. Students A and B cannot be in the same event.2. Each event must have at least one participant.3. Each student can only participate in one event.Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving permutations and combinations with restrictions. Let me recall some related concepts. Assigning students to events where each student goes to exactly one event is similar to distributing distinguishable objects into distinguishable boxes. But here, the boxes (events) must be non-empty, and there are specific restrictions on two of the objects (students A and B).The usual way to approach distributing n distinct objects into k distinct boxes with each box non-empty is by using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula is k! * S(n, k), where S(n, k) is the Stirling numbers of the second kind. But wait, in this case, since the events are distinguishable, assigning different students to different events matters. Wait, actually, if the events are distinguishable and the order within the event doesn&#39;t matter, then it&#39;s exactly the number of onto functions from the set of students to the set of events. The formula for that is indeed k! * S(n, k). So, for the case without any restrictions, the number would be 5! * S(7, 5).But we have the restriction that A and B cannot be in the same event. So we need to subtract the cases where A and B are in the same event. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s easier to calculate the total number without restrictions, subtract the number of assignments where A and B are together. But also considering that each event must have at least one participant. So perhaps the steps are:1. Calculate total number of ways to assign 7 students to 5 events with each event having at least one student, without any restrictions. Let&#39;s call this T. T = 5! * S(7,5).2. Calculate the number of ways where A and B are in the same event, still ensuring each event has at least one student. Let&#39;s call this S. Then the answer would be T - S.Alternatively, maybe I can approach it by first considering the assignments where A and B are in different events, but that might complicate things. Let me see.First, let&#39;s compute T. The Stirling number of the second kind S(7,5) can be calculated using the formula or recurrence. The formula is S(n,k) = S(n-1,k-1) + k*S(n-1,k). But maybe it&#39;s easier to compute it using inclusion-exclusion. The number of onto functions from 7 elements to 5 elements is equal to the sum_{i=0 to 5} (-1)^i * C(5,i) * (5 - i)^7. So:T = sum_{i=0 to 5} (-1)^i * C(5,i) * (5 - i)^7.Calculating that:For i=0: (-1)^0 * C(5,0) * 5^7 = 1 * 1 * 78125 = 78125i=1: (-1)^1 * C(5,1) * 4^7 = -1 * 5 * 16384 = -81920i=2: (-1)^2 * C(5,2) * 3^7 = 1 * 10 * 2187 = 21870i=3: (-1)^3 * C(5,3) * 2^7 = -1 * 10 * 128 = -1280i=4: (-1)^4 * C(5,4) * 1^7 = 1 * 5 * 1 = 5i=5: (-1)^5 * C(5,5) * 0^7 = -1 * 1 * 0 = 0Adding these up: 78125 - 81920 + 21870 - 1280 + 5 = Let&#39;s compute step by step:78125 - 81920 = -3795-3795 + 21870 = 1807518075 - 1280 = 1679516795 + 5 = 16800So T = 16800. Wait, that&#39;s the number of onto functions. But in our case, the events are distinguishable, so assigning students to different events where each event has at least one student is exactly the number of onto functions. Therefore, T = 16800.Now, we need to compute S, the number of such assignments where A and B are in the same event. How do we compute S?If A and B are in the same event, then we can treat them as a single entity. So, effectively, we have 6 &quot;students&quot; to assign: the AB pair and the other 5 students (C, D, E, F, G). But we still need to assign these 6 entities to 5 events, with each event having at least one participant. However, here&#39;s a catch: since we are treating AB as a single entity, but each of the other students is individual. But each of these 6 entities must be assigned to one of the 5 events, with each event having at least one. So the number of ways is the number of onto functions from 6 elements to 5 elements. However, we also need to remember that the AB pair is assigned to one event, and each of the other students is assigned to an event. So the total number would be similar to T, but with n=6 instead of 7. Wait, but AB is treated as a single entity, so the number is 5! * S(6,5). Wait, no, using the same inclusion-exclusion formula.Alternatively, compute the number of onto functions from 6 elements to 5 elements, which is sum_{i=0 to 5} (-1)^i * C(5,i) * (5 - i)^6.Calculating that:i=0: 1 * 1 * 5^6 = 15625i=1: -1 * 5 * 4^6 = -5 * 4096 = -20480i=2: 1 * 10 * 3^6 = 10 * 729 = 7290i=3: -1 * 10 * 2^6 = -10 * 64 = -640i=4: 1 * 5 * 1^6 = 5i=5: -1 * 1 * 0^6 = 0Adding these up:15625 - 20480 = -4855-4855 + 7290 = 24352435 - 640 = 17951795 + 5 = 1800So the number of onto functions from 6 elements to 5 elements is 1800. Therefore, S = 1800. Wait, but AB can be assigned to any of the 5 events. Wait, no, in this calculation, we are treating AB as a single entity, and the number of assignments where AB are together is 1800. Therefore, S = 1800.Therefore, the total number of valid assignments where A and B are not in the same event is T - S = 16800 - 1800 = 15000.Wait, but hold on. Let me verify this. Because when we treat AB as a single entity, we calculated the number of onto functions from 6 entities to 5 events. But in reality, each assignment of AB to an event is counted here, and the other students are assigned to the events, ensuring each event has at least one. But does this account for all possibilities where AB are in the same event? Yes, because if we merge A and B into one entity, then the assignments where they are together are equivalent to assigning this merged entity along with the other 5 students to the 5 events, ensuring each event is non-empty. Therefore, S = 1800.Therefore, subtracting S from T gives 16800 - 1800 = 15000.But wait, hold on. Let me cross-validate this with another approach.Alternatively, another way to compute the number of assignments where A and B are in the same event is as follows:First, choose an event for A and B. There are 5 choices. Then, assign the remaining 5 students (C, D, E, F, G) to the 5 events, ensuring that each event has at least one student. Wait, but if we assigned A and B to one event, then the remaining students need to be assigned in such a way that all other events have at least one student. However, since the event that has A and B can have more students, but the other 4 events must have at least one each. Wait, no: the original problem states each event must have at least one participant. So even the event with A and B must have at least one participant, which it does (A and B are two participants). Wait, no, the problem says each event must have at least one participant. Wait, participants are students. So each event must have at least one student. So if we assign A and B to one event, that event already has two students. Then we need to assign the remaining 5 students (C, D, E, F, G) to the 5 events, but with the condition that each of the other 4 events must have at least one student. Wait, no. Wait, all 5 events must have at least one student. So if we have already assigned A and B to one event, say event 1, then event 1 has at least one participant (actually two). Then we need to assign the remaining 5 students to the 5 events such that the remaining 4 events (events 2-5) each get at least one student. Wait, no. Because the original assignment requires all 5 events to have at least one student. So even if A and B are in event 1, the other 5 students need to cover the remaining 4 events. Wait, but 5 students can&#39;t cover 4 events each with at least one student? Wait, no: if we have 5 students and 4 events, the number of onto functions is 4! * S(5,4). But S(5,4) is 10, so 4! * 10 = 24 * 10 = 240. But here, we need to assign 5 students to 4 events, each event must have at least one student. Wait, but the events are distinguishable, so it&#39;s the number of onto functions, which is 4! * S(5,4) = 240. Then, for each such assignment, the total assignment would be: assign A and B to one event (5 choices), assign the remaining 5 students to the remaining 4 events (240 ways). But wait, but the remaining 5 students can also go to the event where A and B are. Wait, no, because we need to make sure that all 5 events have at least one student. If we assigned A and B to one event, say event 1, then we have to make sure that events 2-5 each have at least one student. Therefore, the remaining 5 students must be assigned to events 2-5 with each of these events getting at least one student. Then, event 1 already has A and B, so it&#39;s covered. Therefore, the number of ways would be:Number of ways = 5 (choices for A and B&#39;s event) * number of onto functions from 5 students to 4 events.The number of onto functions from 5 students to 4 events is 4! * S(5,4) = 24 * 10 = 240, as above. Therefore, the total number S would be 5 * 240 = 1200. Wait, but previously we calculated S as 1800. There is a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?Hmm. Let&#39;s see. In the first approach, we treated AB as a single entity, resulting in 6 entities to assign to 5 events, leading to 1800. In the second approach, we fixed AB in one event, then assigned the remaining 5 students to the remaining 4 events (so that all events are covered), leading to 5 * 240 = 1200.These two different results suggest that there&#39;s a mistake in one of the approaches. Let&#39;s figure out which one is correct.In the first approach: merging AB into one entity, we have 6 entities (AB, C, D, E, F, G) to assign to 5 events. Each event must have at least one entity. The number of such assignments is the number of onto functions from 6 entities to 5 events, which is 5! * S(6,5). However, S(6,5) is 1401 / 5! ? Wait, no, earlier calculation using inclusion-exclusion gave 1800, which is the number of onto functions. Wait, but 5! * S(6,5) is equal to the number of onto functions. Let me check S(6,5). The Stirling numbers of the second kind S(6,5) is equal to C(6,5) + ... Well, the formula is S(n, k) = S(n-1, k-1) + k*S(n-1, k). So:S(6,5) = S(5,4) + 5*S(5,5)We know S(5,4) = 10, S(5,5) = 1. Therefore, S(6,5) = 10 + 5*1 = 15. Therefore, 5! * S(6,5) = 120 * 15 = 1800. So that&#39;s correct. So the first approach gives 1800.But in the second approach, we have 5 * 240 = 1200. Which is different. Why the discrepancy?Ah, here&#39;s the issue: when we fix AB into one event, say event 1, and assign the remaining 5 students to the remaining 4 events (events 2-5), each of these 4 events must have at least one student. However, the total number of assignments is 4! * S(5,4) = 240. Then, multiplied by 5 (for each event AB could be in). However, in this approach, when we assign the remaining 5 students to events 2-5, we are not allowing any of them to go to event 1. But in reality, after assigning AB to event 1, the remaining students can be assigned to any of the 5 events, but we need to ensure that events 2-5 each have at least one student. However, event 1 can have additional students (AB plus some others). Wait, but if we allow the remaining 5 students to be assigned to any of the 5 events, including event 1, but we need events 2-5 to have at least one student each. So in that case, event 1 could have AB plus some of the other students, but events 2-5 must have at least one each. Therefore, the problem reduces to assigning 5 students to 5 events with the restriction that events 2-5 must have at least one student each. Event 1 can have any number, including zero additional students. Wait, but we need the total assignments where all 5 events have at least one student. Since AB are already in event 1, we need event 1 to have at least one student (which it does), and events 2-5 to have at least one each. Therefore, the remaining 5 students must cover events 2-5. Therefore, we can assign the remaining 5 students to the 5 events, but with the constraint that events 2-5 each have at least one student, and event 1 can have any number (including zero). Wait, but the total number of assignments where events 2-5 have at least one student is equivalent to the number of onto functions from 5 students to 4 events (events 2-5). But each student can also go to event 1. Hmm, this is getting complicated.Wait, let&#39;s model this properly. The problem is: assign 5 students (C, D, E, F, G) to 5 events (1,2,3,4,5), with the condition that events 2,3,4,5 each have at least one student. Event 1 can have zero or more. How many ways?This is equivalent to: total number of functions from 5 students to 5 events, minus the functions where at least one of events 2-5 is empty. But since we need events 2-5 to be non-empty, it&#39;s similar to the number of onto functions from the 5 students to events 2-5, and event 1 can have any number. Wait, no. Wait, each student can be assigned to any of the 5 events, but events 2-5 must each have at least one student. So the assignments are all functions where events 2-5 are non-empty. Event 1 can have zero or more.This is equivalent to: the total number of assignments where each of events 2-5 is non-empty, and event 1 can be anything. To compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion. The total number of functions where events 2-5 are non-empty is equal to the sum_{i=0 to 4} (-1)^i * C(4,i) * (5 - i)^5.Because we have 4 events (2-5) that must be non-empty. So the formula is similar to the onto functions but adjusted for the total number of available events. Let&#39;s compute this.Compute sum_{i=0 to 4} (-1)^i * C(4,i) * (5 - i)^5.For i=0: (-1)^0 * C(4,0) * 5^5 = 1 * 1 * 3125 = 3125i=1: (-1)^1 * C(4,1) * 4^5 = -4 * 1024 = -4096i=2: (-1)^2 * C(4,2) * 3^5 = 6 * 243 = 1458i=3: (-1)^3 * C(4,3) * 2^5 = -4 * 32 = -128i=4: (-1)^4 * C(4,4) * 1^5 = 1 * 1 = 1Adding these up:3125 - 4096 = -971-971 + 1458 = 487487 - 128 = 359359 + 1 = 360Therefore, the number of assignments where events 2-5 are non-empty is 360. But wait, each student can be assigned to any of the 5 events, but events 2-5 must be non-empty. However, since we have 5 students, the minimal number of students needed to cover events 2-5 is 4, leaving one student who can go to any event (including event 1). But according to the inclusion-exclusion calculation, there are 360 ways.But wait, 360 seems low. Let me check with another approach.Alternatively, the number of surjective functions from 5 students to 4 events (events 2-5) is 4! * S(5,4) = 24 * 10 = 240. Then, for each such surjective function, the remaining student(s) can be assigned to any of the 5 events. Wait, no. Wait, if we require that all events 2-5 have at least one student, but students can also go to event 1. So it&#39;s not exactly surjective functions to 4 events. Instead, it&#39;s the number of functions where events 2-5 are covered, but students can also go to event 1. This is equivalent to the inclusion-exclusion result of 360.Therefore, the number of ways to assign the 5 students to the 5 events with events 2-5 non-empty is 360. Therefore, the total number of assignments where A and B are in the same event (which can be any of the 5 events) is 5 * 360 = 1800. Which matches the first approach. Therefore, the initial second approach was incorrect because I miscalculated the constraints. The correct number is 5 * 360 = 1800, which matches the first method.Therefore, the number of invalid assignments (where A and B are together) is 1800, and the total valid assignments are 16800 - 1800 = 15000.Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm with another angle. Suppose instead of using inclusion-exclusion, we model the problem as follows:Total number of assignments where all events have at least one student: 16800.Number of assignments where A and B are in the same event: ?Alternatively, we can compute it as follows: choose an event for A and B (5 choices), assign the remaining 5 students to the 5 events, ensuring that all events have at least one student. However, since event with A and B already has two students, but the other events must have at least one. Therefore, after placing A and B in an event, we need to assign the remaining 5 students such that the remaining 4 events each have at least one student. Wait, but that would only require the remaining 5 students to cover the remaining 4 events. So each of the remaining 4 events must have at least one student, and the fifth student can go anywhere. Wait, no, the original problem requires all 5 events to have at least one student. If we have already placed A and B in one event, then the remaining 5 students must cover the other 4 events. Because if we don&#39;t, then those 4 events would be empty. Therefore, the remaining 5 students must be assigned to the 5 events, but with the 4 events (excluding the one with A and B) needing at least one each. Wait, this is similar to the previous calculation.Wait, no. If we have already placed A and B in event 1, then events 2-5 must have at least one student each. Therefore, the remaining 5 students need to cover events 2-5. So each of events 2-5 must have at least one student, and the fifth student can be assigned to any event (including event 1). Wait, but if we have 5 students to cover 4 events (2-5), each needing at least one student. So the number of ways is the number of surjective functions from 5 students to 4 events (events 2-5), multiplied by the number of ways to assign the fifth student (but wait, no, the fifth student is part of the 5 students). Wait, actually, this is again the surjective function. The number of ways to assign 5 students to 4 events (events 2-5) such that each event has at least one student. That is 4! * S(5,4) = 24 * 10 = 240. Then, for each of these assignments, the students in events 2-5 are covered, and event 1 has A and B plus any students assigned to it. However, in this case, the fifth student isn&#39;t an extra; rather, we have exactly 5 students to cover 4 events, each with at least one. The number of such assignments is 240. Then, multiplying by 5 (for each possible event that A and B could be in) gives 5 * 240 = 1200, which contradicts the previous result.But according to inclusion-exclusion, it&#39;s 1800. There&#39;s clearly a conflict here. So which one is correct?Wait, no. When we assign the remaining 5 students after placing A and B in an event, we have to ensure that all 5 events are covered. Since event 1 already has A and B, it&#39;s covered. The remaining 5 students must cover the remaining 4 events. So each of events 2-5 must have at least one student among the remaining 5. The number of ways to assign 5 students to 4 events (events 2-5) with each event getting at least one is indeed 4! * S(5,4) = 240. Therefore, for each choice of event for A and B (5 choices), we have 240 assignments. Therefore, total S = 5 * 240 = 1200. But this contradicts the inclusion-exclusion result of 1800.What is the problem here? Let&#39;s think carefully.The first approach treats AB as a single entity, so effectively, we have 6 entities (AB, C, D, E, F, G) to assign to 5 events, each event must have at least one entity. The number of such assignments is 1800. However, in this scenario, when AB is assigned to an event, the other students can be in any event, including the same event as AB. But in this case, the event with AB can have multiple entities (students), but since AB is considered as one entity, but in reality, AB are two students. However, when we calculate the assignments, we are counting the number of ways to assign the 6 entities (AB and the 5 others) to the 5 events with each event non-empty. But the problem is that each entity (including AB) is considered as a single unit, but AB is actually two students. Therefore, merging AB into a single entity is not the correct approach because the other students can be assigned to the same event as AB, but in reality, each student is an individual. Therefore, the first approach might be overcounting or undercounting.Wait a second, perhaps merging AB into a single entity is incorrect because when we do that, we are treating AB as a single unit, but the other students can be assigned to the same event as AB, but in reality, AB is two students. However, the problem is not about how many students are in an event, but just the assignment of each student to an event. So the merging approach may not be appropriate here. Let me clarify.If we merge A and B into a single entity, we are essentially forcing them to be together, but when calculating the total number of assignments where they are together, we need to consider that they are two separate students assigned to the same event. Therefore, the correct way to compute the number of assignments where A and B are in the same event is to first choose an event for both A and B, then assign the remaining students to all events, ensuring that each event has at least one student. But when we choose an event for A and B, that event already has two students, so the remaining 5 students need to be assigned such that the other 4 events each have at least one student. However, the remaining 5 students can be assigned to any of the 5 events, but the other 4 events must have at least one student. Therefore, the remaining 5 students must cover the other 4 events. That is, the number of ways to assign 5 students to 5 events with the condition that 4 specific events (the ones not containing A and B) must each have at least one student. This is similar to the problem of surjective functions with some events required to be non-empty.Alternatively, think of it as follows: after placing A and B in one event (say event 1), we need to assign the remaining 5 students to the 5 events such that events 2-5 each have at least one student. Event 1 can have any number of students (including just A and B). This is equivalent to the number of functions from the 5 students to the 5 events, with the constraint that events 2-5 are non-empty. The number of such functions is equal to the inclusion-exclusion formula we calculated earlier, which was 360. Therefore, for each of the 5 choices of the event for A and B, we have 360 assignments. Therefore, S = 5 * 360 = 1800, which matches the first approach.But why did the second approach where we thought of assigning 5 students to 4 events get 240? Because in that case, we were restricting the remaining 5 students to only the 4 events (events 2-5), which would mean that event 1 cannot have any additional students. However, in reality, after placing A and B in event 1, the remaining students can go to any event, including event 1. But we need to ensure that events 2-5 each have at least one student. Therefore, the correct way is to allow the remaining 5 students to go to any events, but with the requirement that events 2-5 are covered. This is precisely what the inclusion-exclusion calculation gave as 360. So the error in the second approach was restricting the remaining students to only events 2-5, which is incorrect. They can also go to event 1, but events 2-5 must still be covered. Therefore, the correct number is 360 per choice of event for A and B, leading to 5 * 360 = 1800.Therefore, both approaches agree that S = 1800, so the answer should be 16800 - 1800 = 15000. However, I should verify this with another method to be absolutely sure.Let me try a different approach. Let&#39;s use the principle of inclusion-exclusion directly on the total number of assignments.Total number of assignments where each event has at least one student: 16800.Number of assignments where A and B are in the same event: ?Alternatively, the number of assignments where A and B are in the same event can be calculated by considering all possible assignments where A and B are together, subtracting those that leave some events empty.But maybe that&#39;s too vague. Let&#39;s think in terms of inclusion-exclusion for the forbidden assignments.The total number of assignments where each event has at least one student is 16800. From this, we need to subtract the number of assignments where A and B are in the same event. However, these two sets (total assignments and assignments with A and B together) both require that all events are non-empty. Therefore, the inclusion-exclusion is being handled within the calculation of S = 1800.Therefore, the final answer is 16800 - 1800 = 15000.But let me check with a small example to see if this reasoning holds.Suppose there are 2 students and 2 events. Each event must have at least one student, and students cannot be in the same event. The total number of assignments is 2! = 2. The number of assignments where they are in the same event is 0, since each event must have at least one student and there are 2 students. But according to the formula, T = 2! * S(2,2) = 2 * 1 = 2. S would be the number of assignments where they are together. But with 2 students and 2 events, each event must have exactly one student, so they can&#39;t be together. Therefore, the answer is 2 - 0 = 2. Which is correct.Another example: 3 students, 2 events. Total onto assignments: 2! * S(3,2) = 2 * 3 = 6. If two students cannot be together, say A and B, then the number of assignments where A and B are together is: treat AB as one entity, then we have 2 entities (AB and C) to assign to 2 events. The number of onto assignments is 2! * S(2,2) = 2 * 1 = 2. Therefore, the answer is 6 - 2 = 4. Which can be verified manually:Possible assignments (events 1 and 2):Each student must be in an event, each event has at least one.Total assignments: 2^3 - 2 = 6 (subtracting the two cases where all are in event 1 or all in event 2).Now, assignments where A and B are together:If AB are in event 1, then C can be in event 2.If AB are in event 2, then C can be in event 1.But also, assignments where AB are together and C is with them. Wait, no, since each event must have at least one student. If AB are in event 1, then C must be in event 2. Similarly, if AB are in event 2, C must be in event 1. Therefore, there are only 2 assignments where AB are together. Therefore, the answer is 6 - 2 = 4, which matches the formula. Therefore, the formula works here.Therefore, returning to the original problem, the answer should be 15000.But to make sure, let me see if there is any other way this could be approached.Alternatively, we can think of the problem as arranging the 7 students into 5 non-empty groups (since each event must have at least one participant), and then assigning these groups to the 5 distinct events. The number of ways to partition the students into 5 non-empty groups is S(7,5), and then multiply by 5! to assign the groups to events. Then, subtract the number of such arrangements where A and B are in the same group.The number of arrangements where A and B are in the same group is calculated by considering them as a single entity, so we have 6 entities, partition them into 5 groups, which is S(6,5), and then multiply by 5! to assign to events. Therefore, the total number is 5! * (S(7,5) - S(6,5)) = 120 * (140 - 15) = 120 * 125 = 15000. Which matches our previous result.Yes, because S(7,5) is 140, S(6,5) is 15. Therefore, 140 - 15 = 125, multiplied by 5! = 120 gives 15000. Therefore, this confirms the result.Therefore, the answer is 15000.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2df99828></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2df99828><span class="icon" data-v-2df99828>✅:</span>The number of valid ways to assign the 7 students to 5 events under the given conditions is calculated as follows:1.

Each event has participants and each person participates in only one event.Step-by-Step Calculation:# Case 1: One event with 3 participants, and the rest with 1 participant each1. Select 3 participants for the event with 3 participants:    - We need to choose 3 out of the 7 students to participate in one event. This can be done in ( binom{7}{3} ) ways.    - Calculation:     [    binom{7}{3} = frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = frac{7 times 6 times 5}{3 times 2 times 1} = 35    ]2. Arrange the other 4 participants in the remaining 4 events:    - There are 4 students left, and they need to be arranged into 4 different events, one student per event. This can be done in ( 4! ) ways.    - Calculation:    [    4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24    ]   3. Arrange 5 events:    - The one event with 3 participants, and the remaining 4 events can be permuted in ( 5! ) ways.    - Calculation:    [    5! = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120    ]4. Subtract the invalid cases (where 甲 and 乙 are both in the 3-participant event):    - We need to subtract the cases where 甲 and 乙 are both selected for the 3-participant event, and another student is the third. Choose the last student for this event ( binom{5}{1} ) ways (as we exclude 甲 and 乙).    - Calculation:    [    binom{5}{1} = 5    ]So, the number of valid arrangements in this case:    [    35 times 24 times 120 - 5 times 120 = 100800 - 600 = 3600    ]# Case 2: Two events with 2 participants each, and 1 participant for the remaining event1. Select 2 participants for each of the 2 specific events (4 participants total):    - Choose 4 out of 7 participants (2 pairs), which can be done in ( binom{7}{2} times binom{5}{2} ) ways.    - Calculation:    [    binom{7}{2} times binom{5}{2} = frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} times frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 21 times 10 = 210    ]2.

Arrange the 5 events:    - The 2 double-participant events (2 identical groups) and the 3 single-participant events can be permuted in ( 5! ), divided by the permutations of the 2 identical groups to avoid overcounting.    - Calculation:    [    frac{5!}{2!} = frac{120}{2} = 60    ]4.

So Vasya wrote a correct statement where 1/3 of all digits are the digit 3, and 1/2 of all digits are the digit 1. Now Kolya wrote a similar phrase but with more fractions and digits, and we need to fill in the blanks with three different digits and three different numbers to make the statement correct.First, let me understand Kolya&#39;s phrase structure. It says:&quot;In this phrase, 1/... of all digits are the digit *, the fractions of digits * and * are equal and equal to 1/..., and the fraction of all other digits is 1/….&quot;So, there are three fractions (denominators to be filled in the ...) and three digits (the *s). All three digits must be different, and the three denominators (numbers) must also be different. The fractions mentioned are for the digits in the entire phrase itself. So, the statement refers to the digits within the phrase Kolya wrote. Our task is to replace the *s and ...s with appropriate digits and numbers so that when we count the digits in the entire phrase, the fractions hold true.Let me start by analyzing Vasya&#39;s original statement to see how it worked. In his phrase, 1/3 of the digits are 3, and 1/2 are 1. So the total number of digits must be a multiple of both 3 and 2, which is 6. Let&#39;s check:Original phrase: &quot;In this phrase, 1 / 3 of all digits are the digit 3, and 1 / 2 of all digits are the digit 1.&quot;Let me count the digits in that phrase. Let&#39;s break it down word by word:&quot;In&quot; has no digits. &quot;this&quot; has no digits. &quot;phrase&quot; has no digits. The comma and space after it: no digits. &quot;1&quot; is a digit &#39;1&#39;. &quot;/&quot; is not a digit. &quot;3&quot; is a digit &#39;3&#39;. &quot;of&quot; no digits. &quot;all&quot; no digits. &quot;digits&quot; no digits. &quot;are&quot; no digits. &quot;the&quot; no digits. &quot;digit&quot; no digits. &quot;3&quot; is a digit &#39;3&#39;. &quot;,&quot; comma, no. &quot;and&quot; no. &quot;1&quot; digit &#39;1&#39;. &quot;/&quot; no. &quot;2&quot; digit &#39;2&#39;. &quot;of&quot; no. &quot;all&quot; no. &quot;digits&quot; no. &quot;are&quot; no. &quot;the&quot; no. &quot;digit&quot; no. &quot;1&quot; digit &#39;1&#39;. Period.So let&#39;s list all digits in Vasya&#39;s original statement:1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1. That&#39;s six digits: three 1s, two 3s, and one 2. Wait, but the original statement says 1/3 are 3s and 1/2 are 1s. But according to my count, there are 3 1s (which would be 3/6 = 1/2) and 2 3s (2/6 = 1/3). But wait, 3s are 2 out of 6, which is 1/3. 1s are 3 out of 6, which is 1/2. So that checks out. But in the count, there&#39;s also a &#39;2&#39;. But the original statement didn&#39;t mention the 2. So perhaps in Kolya&#39;s problem, he also might have other digits not mentioned, but their fraction is given as 1/... So Kolya&#39;s phrase mentions three fractions: one for a digit *, two digits * and * with equal fractions, and the remaining fraction for all other digits.Wait, the structure of Kolya&#39;s phrase is:&quot;In this phrase, 1/... of all digits are the digit *, the fractions of digits * and * are equal and equal to 1/..., and the fraction of all other digits is 1/….&quot;So, first part: 1/(first number) of all digits are digit1.Second part: fractions of digits digit2 and digit3 are equal and equal to 1/(second number).Third part: the fraction of all other digits is 1/(third number).So total fractions should add up to 1. So:(1/first_number) + (1/second_number) + (1/second_number) + (1/third_number) = 1?Wait, no. Wait, first part is one digit with 1/first_number. Then, two digits each with 1/second_number. Then &quot;all other digits&quot; have 1/third_number. So the fractions would be:Let me think. Let&#39;s denote:- Let total digits be T.- Digit1 occurs T / first_number times.- Digit2 and Digit3 each occur T / second_number times.- All other digits (if any) occur T / third_number times in total.Wait, but the problem says &quot;the fraction of all other digits is 1/…&quot;. So &quot;all other digits&quot; as a combined fraction. So if there are other digits besides digit1, digit2, digit3, then their total fraction is 1/third_number.Therefore, the sum of the fractions would be:(1/first_number) + (1/second_number) + (1/second_number) + (1/third_number) = 1Wait, because digit1 is 1/first_number, digit2 is 1/second_number, digit3 is 1/second_number, and all others (if any) are 1/third_number. But if there are no other digits, then 1/third_number must be zero, which is not possible. Therefore, there must be at least one other digit, making the total fractions sum to 1.But let&#39;s check:1/first_number + 2/second_number + 1/third_number = 1Because digit2 and digit3 each have 1/second_number, so together 2/second_number, and other digits have 1/third_number.So, the equation to satisfy is:1/a + 2/b + 1/c = 1, where a, b, c are three different numbers (denominators) and digit1, digit2, digit3 are three different digits.Additionally, the digits in the phrase must satisfy the counts:digit1 count = T/a,digit2 count = T/b,digit3 count = T/b,other digits count = T/c.Moreover, T must be divisible by a, b, c. Because counts must be integers.So, first step is to find integers a, b, c (distinct), and digits d1, d2, d3 (distinct), such that 1/a + 2/b + 1/c = 1, and then total digits T is a common multiple of a, b, c. Then, counts of digits would be T/a, T/b, T/b, T/c. But also, since we are to write the phrase in English, the digits present in the phrase will include the digits used in the fractions (the numbers a, b, c) and the digits d1, d2, d3. So the digits in the phrase are a mix of d1, d2, d3, and the digits in the numbers a, b, c, and possibly other digits from the English words.Wait, but the original problem says that in Vasya&#39;s statement, the digits in the phrase were the digits used in the fractions (the 1, 3, and 2). So in Kolya&#39;s case, perhaps similar: the digits in the phrase will include the digits used in the fractions (the denominators a, b, c) and the digits d1, d2, d3. So we need to make sure that the counts of d1, d2, d3 correspond to T/a, T/b, T/b, and the count of other digits (which would include the digits from a, b, c) is T/c. But this is a bit more complex, because the denominators a, b, c are numbers written in the phrase, so their digits contribute to the total counts. Similarly, the digits d1, d2, d3 are mentioned in the text, so writing them as words or symbols?Wait, in Vasya&#39;s original statement, the digits 1, 3, and 2 were written as numeric digits (i.e., &#39;1&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;2&#39;), not as words. For example, &quot;1 / 3 of all digits...&quot; So in Kolya&#39;s phrase, the digits d1, d2, d3 would be written as numbers (like * in the phrase is replaced by a digit). So for example, if d1 is 2, then the phrase would say &quot;the digit 2&quot;. Therefore, each mention of a digit in the phrase adds that digit to the count. Also, the denominators a, b, c are written as numbers, so if a is 4, then writing &quot;1/4&quot; adds digits &#39;1&#39; and &#39;4&#39; to the count.Therefore, the total digits in Kolya&#39;s phrase will include:- The digits from the denominators a, b, c (each written as numbers in the fractions).- The digits d1, d2, d3 (each written as numbers in the text, e.g., &quot;the digit 5&quot;).- Other digits that come from writing the rest of the sentence (like the word &quot;digit&quot; doesn&#39;t contain digits, but numbers like &quot;1&quot; in &quot;1/...&quot; do).Therefore, we need to model the entire phrase and count all digits in it, considering both the numbers in the fractions (a, b, c) and the digits mentioned (d1, d2, d3).This seems complicated. Let&#39;s try to model it step by step.First, we need to choose three different digits d1, d2, d3 and three different numbers a, b, c such that when we write the phrase, the counts of d1, d2, d3, and other digits satisfy:count(d1) = T/a,count(d2) = count(d3) = T/b,count(other digits) = T/c,and 1/a + 2/b + 1/c = 1.Additionally, the total digits T is the sum of all digits in the phrase, which includes:- The digits from writing the denominators a, b, c.- The digits d1, d2, d3 mentioned in the text.- Any other digits that come from numbers in the phrase (like if the phrase has &quot;1/...&quot; which includes a &#39;1&#39;).Wait, hold on. Let&#39;s parse Kolya&#39;s phrase as it would be filled in:&quot;In this phrase, 1/[a] of all digits are the digit [d1], the fractions of digits [d2] and [d3] are equal and equal to 1/[b], and the fraction of all other digits is 1/[c].&quot;So, in this phrase, the denominators are a, b, c (numbers), and the digits mentioned are d1, d2, d3 (digits). Therefore, writing this phrase would include:- The digits in &quot;1/[a]&quot;, which are &#39;1&#39;, &#39;/&#39;, and the digits of a. However, only the digits count, so if a is, say, 4, then &quot;1/4&quot; contributes digits &#39;1&#39; and &#39;4&#39;.- Similarly, &quot;1/[b]&quot; contributes &#39;1&#39; and the digits of b.- &quot;1/[c]&quot; contributes &#39;1&#39; and the digits of c.- The digits [d1], [d2], [d3] in the text, each written as a single digit. So if d1 is 5, then &quot;digit 5&quot; contributes a &#39;5&#39;.Therefore, the total digits in the phrase are:- From &quot;1/[a]&quot;: &#39;1&#39; and each digit of a.- From &quot;1/[b]&quot;: &#39;1&#39; and each digit of b.- From &quot;1/[c]&quot;: &#39;1&#39; and each digit of c.- From mentions of [d1], [d2], [d3]: each of these digits once.Additionally, check if there are any other digits in the phrase. The rest of the phrase is in English words, which do not contain digits. So unless there are numbers written as words (like &quot;one&quot;), but in the original problem, Vasya&#39;s statement used numerals (&#39;1&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;2&#39;), so we can assume Kolya&#39;s phrase also uses numerals. Therefore, the digits in the phrase are only those in the fractions (1, a, b, c) and the mentioned digits d1, d2, d3.Therefore, total digits T is equal to:Number of digits in &quot;1/[a]&quot; (which is 1 + number of digits in a) +Number of digits in &quot;1/[b]&quot; (which is 1 + number of digits in b) +Number of digits in &quot;1/[c]&quot; (which is 1 + number of digits in c) +Number of digits from d1, d2, d3 (each is 1 digit, so 3) +Any other digits? The original structure is:&quot;In this phrase, 1/[a] of all digits are the digit [d1], the fractions of digits [d2] and [d3] are equal and equal to 1/[b], and the fraction of all other digits is 1/[c].&quot;Looking at this, the only digits are those in 1/a, 1/b, 1/c, and the digits d1, d2, d3. The rest of the words do not contain digits.Therefore, total digits T = (1 + len(a)) + (1 + len(b)) + (1 + len(c)) + 3.Where len(a) is the number of digits in a, etc. For example, if a is 4 (one digit), len(a)=1; if a is 10 (two digits), len(a)=2.But we need to ensure that a, b, c are numbers (denominators) written in the phrase, and they must be different. Also, d1, d2, d3 are different digits.But we have to consider that the digits in a, b, c will also contribute to the counts. For example, if a is 3, then writing &quot;1/3&quot; adds a &#39;3&#39; to the digit counts, which may interfere with the desired counts for d1, d2, d3.This seems complex. Let&#39;s outline the steps:1. Choose denominators a, b, c (distinct numbers).2. Choose digits d1, d2, d3 (distinct digits).3. Compute total digits T as 3 (from d1, d2, d3) + 3 (from the &#39;1&#39;s in 1/a, 1/b, 1/c) + sum of digits in a, b, c.4. The counts for d1, d2, d3 must be T/a, T/b, T/b, respectively.But counts for d1, d2, d3 include:- The explicit mentions of d1, d2, d3 in the text (each once).- Any occurrences of d1, d2, d3 in the denominators a, b, c.Similarly, counts for other digits (denoted as T/c) include:- The &#39;1&#39;s from the fractions (three &#39;1&#39;s from &quot;1/a&quot;, &quot;1/b&quot;, &quot;1/c&quot;).- The digits in a, b, c that are not d1, d2, d3.Therefore, it&#39;s a system of equations with multiple variables.This is quite involved. Let&#39;s try to approach this step by step.First, let&#39;s suppose that a, b, c are single-digit numbers. That would simplify things, as len(a)=len(b)=len(c)=1. Then, total digits T would be 3 (from d1, d2, d3) + 3 (from the three &#39;1&#39;s in &quot;1/a&quot;, &quot;1/b&quot;, &quot;1/c&quot;) + 3 (from a, b, c) = 9 digits. But let&#39;s check:If a, b, c are single-digit, then &quot;1/a&quot; has two digits: &#39;1&#39; and a. Similarly for &quot;1/b&quot; and &quot;1/c&quot;. So each fraction contributes two digits. There are three fractions: 1/a, 1/b, 1/c. So 3*2=6 digits. Then, the digits d1, d2, d3 are each mentioned once, so three more digits. Total T=6+3=9. But wait, the three fractions each contribute two digits (1 and a, etc.), so that&#39;s 3*2=6. The three digits d1, d2, d3 mentioned once each, so 3. So total T=9. However, in addition, the numbers a, b, c themselves are digits in the fractions. For example, if a is 4, then &quot;1/4&quot; contributes &#39;1&#39; and &#39;4&#39;, and the &#39;4&#39; is part of the denominator. So the digits from the denominators are a, b, c (each one digit). Therefore, in the total count:- The three &#39;1&#39;s from &quot;1/a&quot;, &quot;1/b&quot;, &quot;1/c&quot;.- The three denominator digits a, b, c.- The three mentioned digits d1, d2, d3.Total digits: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.Therefore, if a, b, c are single-digit, T=9.But then, according to the problem:count(d1) = T/a = 9/a,count(d2) = count(d3) = T/b = 9/b,count(other digits) = T/c = 9/c.But the counts of d1, d2, d3 are:- Each mentioned once in the text.- Plus, if d1 is equal to a, b, or c, then the count increases by how many times d1 appears in the denominators.Similarly, d2 and d3.Similarly, other digits include the &#39;1&#39;s and the denominators&#39; digits that are not d1, d2, d3.So for example, if d1 is 2, and a=2, then count(d1) = 1 (from the mention) + 1 (from the denominator a=2) = 2. But according to the formula, count(d1) should be 9/a = 9/2, which is 4.5, which is impossible. Therefore, denominators a, b, c must divide 9, since T=9. So possible denominators are 1, 3, 9. But denominators must be different, and greater than 1 (since 1/1 is 1, which would leave no room for other fractions). Wait, but 1/a + 2/b +1/c =1. If a=3, b=9, c=9, but they must be different. Wait, let&#39;s check.If T=9, then possible a, b, c must divide 9. So possible denominators are 1, 3, 9. But 1 is invalid because 1/1 is 1, leaving no room for other fractions. So possible denominators are 3 and 9.But we need three different denominators. If T=9, denominators must be divisors of 9, which are 1, 3, 9. But 1 is invalid. So only 3 and 9. But we need three different denominators. This is impossible. Therefore, our assumption that a, b, c are single-digit might be wrong.Alternatively, maybe a, b, c are multi-digit numbers, which would increase T. Let&#39;s consider that.Suppose a, b, c are two-digit numbers. Then, for example, &quot;1/10&quot; would contribute digits &#39;1&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39; (assuming a=10). Then, len(a)=2, len(b)=2, len(c)=2. Then total digits:From fractions: 3*(1 + 2) = 9 digits (each fraction has 1 + len(a) digits).From mentioned digits d1, d2, d3: 3 digits.From denominators a, b, c: each two digits, so 3*2=6 digits.Wait, no. Wait, if a is 10, then &quot;1/10&quot; contributes &#39;1&#39;, &#39;/&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, but we only count digits: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39; (three digits). Similarly for b and c. So each two-digit denominator would add two digits (since the denominator is two digits). Therefore, each fraction &quot;1/[a]&quot; would contribute 1 (the &#39;1&#39;) + len(a) digits. So if a is two-digit, then 1 + 2 = 3 digits per fraction. Three fractions: 3*3 =9 digits. The mentioned digits d1, d2, d3: 3 digits. The denominators a, b, c: each two digits, so 3*2=6 digits. Wait, but the denominators are already included in the fractions. For example, &quot;1/10&quot; includes the denominator 10, which is part of the fraction. Therefore, the digits from a, b, c are already counted in the fractions. Therefore, total digits would be:From the three fractions: each &quot;1/[a]&quot; is &#39;1&#39; followed by the digits of a. So for each fraction, 1 + number of digits in a, b, c. If a, b, c are two-digit numbers, then each fraction contributes 1 + 2 = 3 digits. Three fractions: 3*3=9 digits.From the mentioned digits d1, d2, d3: 3 digits.Therefore, total digits T=9 + 3=12.Additionally, if a, b, c are two-digit numbers, their digits (the tens and units digits) are part of the fractions. So for example, if a=12, then &#39;1&#39; and &#39;2&#39; are in the fraction &quot;1/12&quot;. So those digits contribute to the counts.Thus, in this case, T=12. Then, the counts for d1, d2, d3 would be T/a =12/a, T/b=12/b, T/c=12/c. But again, a, b, c must divide 12. So possible denominators are 1,2,3,4,6,12. But a, b, c must be two-digit numbers (if we assume len(a)=2). So possible denominators are 10 to 99. But 12 divides 12, so a=12 is possible, which is a two-digit number. Similarly, 6 is a single-digit, so maybe not.But the problem is that if a, b, c are two-digit numbers, T=12. Then, T/a must be an integer. So a must divide 12. Possible two-digit divisors of 12 are 12 itself. Similarly, b must divide 12, so possible two-digit b is 12. But we need three different denominators. Therefore, this approach might not work.Alternatively, maybe T is larger. Perhaps we need to find a, b, c such that T is a common multiple, and a, b, c can be multi-digit numbers. This is getting complicated.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that the denominators a, b, c are written as numbers in the phrase, contributing their digits. Let&#39;s attempt to model this more precisely.Let me denote:- Let’s denote the three fractions as 1/a, 1/b (twice), and 1/c.- The equation is 1/a + 2/b + 1/c = 1.- Total digits T = sum of digits in all parts:  - The three fractions &quot;1/a&quot;, &quot;1/b&quot;, &quot;1/c&quot;: each has a &#39;1&#39; and the digits of a, b, c respectively.  - The three mentioned digits d1, d2, d3: each contributes one digit.Therefore, T = (number of digits in &quot;1/a&quot;) + (number of digits in &quot;1/b&quot;) + (number of digits in &quot;1/c&quot;) + 3.Where the number of digits in &quot;1/x&quot; is 1 + number of digits in x.Therefore, T = (1 + len(a)) + (1 + len(b)) + (1 + len(c)) + 3 = 3 + len(a) + len(b) + len(c) + 3 = 6 + len(a) + len(b) + len(c).But len(a), len(b), len(c) are the number of digits in a, b, c.So T = 6 + len(a) + len(b) + len(c).But at the same time, T must satisfy:count(d1) = T/a,count(d2) = count(d3) = T/b,count(other digits) = T/c.But count(d1) includes:- The explicit mention of d1 in the phrase (1 digit).- Any occurrences of d1 in the denominators a, b, c.Similarly for d2 and d3.Count of other digits includes:- The three &#39;1&#39;s from the fractions.- Any digits in the denominators a, b, c that are not d1, d2, d3.Therefore, this is a system where we need to find a, b, c (different numbers), d1, d2, d3 (different digits), such that:1. 1/a + 2/b + 1/c = 1.2. T = 6 + len(a) + len(b) + len(c).3. count(d1) = 1 + number of times d1 appears in a, b, c = T/a.4. count(d2) = 1 + number of times d2 appears in a, b, c = T/b.5. count(d3) = 1 + number of times d3 appears in a, b, c = T/b.6. count(other digits) = 3 (from &#39;1&#39;s) + sum_{digits in a,b,c not d1,d2,d3} = T/c.This is quite complex. Let&#39;s try to find possible a, b, c.First, let&#39;s look for small denominators a, b, c such that 1/a + 2/b +1/c =1.Possible combinations:Let’s suppose a=4, b=6, c=12.Check 1/4 + 2/6 +1/12 = 0.25 + 0.333... +0.083... ≈0.666..., which is less than 1.Another try: a=3, b=4, c=6.1/3 + 2/4 +1/6 = 1/3 + 1/2 +1/6 = (2/6 +3/6 +1/6)=6/6=1. Yes, this works.So a=3, b=4, c=6.This gives 1/3 + 2/4 +1/6 =1.Simplify 2/4 to 1/2: 1/3 +1/2 +1/6 = (2/6 +3/6 +1/6)=6/6=1. Correct.Now, a=3, b=4, c=6. Different numbers.Now, let&#39;s check if these denominators can work.First, T =6 + len(a) + len(b) + len(c). Since a=3 (1 digit), b=4 (1 digit), c=6 (1 digit). So T=6+1+1+1=9.So T=9.Therefore:count(d1) =9/3=3,count(d2)=count(d3)=9/4=2.25. Not integer. Problem.So this combination doesn&#39;t work because 9/4 is not integer.Hence, even though the fractions sum to 1, T=9 is not divisible by b=4.So need to find a combination where T is divisible by a, b, c.Let’s try another combination.Suppose a=5, b=5, c=5. But denominators must be different.Another combination: a=2, b=5, c=10.1/2 +2/5 +1/10 =0.5 +0.4 +0.1=1.0.Yes, this works.Check T.a=2 (1 digit), b=5 (1 digit), c=10 (2 digits). Therefore len(a)=1, len(b)=1, len(c)=2.Thus T=6 +1 +1 +2=10.Now, T=10.Check:count(d1)=10/2=5,count(d2)=count(d3)=10/5=2,count(other digits)=10/10=1.But we need to see if the counts can be achieved considering the digits in the phrase.The phrase will have:- From &quot;1/2&quot;: digits &#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;.- From &quot;1/5&quot;: digits &#39;1&#39;, &#39;5&#39;.- From &quot;1/10&quot;: digits &#39;1&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39;.- From mentioned digits d1, d2, d3: three digits.So total digits:From fractions: &#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;5&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;0&#39; → 7 digits.From mentioned digits: d1, d2, d3 → 3 digits.Total T=7+3=10. Correct.Now, the digits in the phrase are:In fractions: &#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;5&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;0&#39;.Mentioned digits: d1, d2, d3.So all digits in the phrase are: the three mentioned digits plus the digits from fractions: &#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;5&#39;,&#39;0&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;1&#39; (wait, let&#39;s count properly):From &quot;1/2&quot;: &#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;.From &quot;1/5&quot;: &#39;1&#39;,&#39;5&#39;.From &quot;1/10&quot;: &#39;1&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;0&#39;.From mentioned digits: d1, d2, d3.So digits from fractions: &#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39; → that&#39;s two &#39;1&#39;s in &quot;1/2&quot;, one &#39;1&#39; in &quot;1/5&quot;, two &#39;1&#39;s in &quot;1/10&quot;, plus &#39;2&#39;,&#39;5&#39;,&#39;0&#39;.Wait, no:Wait, &quot;1/2&quot; is &#39;1&#39;, &#39;/&#39;, &#39;2&#39; → digits &#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;.&quot;1/5&quot; is &#39;1&#39;, &#39;/&#39;, &#39;5&#39; → digits &#39;1&#39;,&#39;5&#39;.&quot;1/10&quot; is &#39;1&#39;, &#39;/&#39;, &#39;1&#39;,&#39;0&#39; → digits &#39;1&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;0&#39;.So total digits from fractions: [&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;0&#39;] → seven digits: four &#39;1&#39;s, one &#39;2&#39;, one &#39;5&#39;, one &#39;0&#39;.Then the mentioned digits d1, d2, d3: three digits. So total digits T=7+3=10.So all digits in the phrase are:Four &#39;1&#39;s, one &#39;2&#39;, one &#39;5&#39;, one &#39;0&#39;, plus d1, d2, d3.Now, counts:count(d1)=5 (as per T/a=10/2=5),count(d2)=count(d3)=2 (T/b=10/5=2),count(other digits)=1 (T/c=10/10=1).But the &#39;other digits&#39; are the digits not d1, d2, d3. Let&#39;s see:The digits from the fractions are &#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;5&#39;,&#39;0&#39; plus the mentioned digits d1, d2, d3.If we choose d1, d2, d3 to be, say, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, then:count(d1)=count(&#39;1&#39;)=4 (from fractions) +1 (mentioned)=5. Which matches T/a=5.count(d2)=count(&#39;2&#39;)=1 (from fractions) +1 (mentioned)=2. Which matches T/b=2.count(d3)=count(&#39;5&#39;)=1 (from fractions) +1 (mentioned)=2. Which matches T/b=2.Then, other digits are &#39;0&#39; and possibly others. Wait, but d1, d2, d3 are &#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;5&#39;, so &#39;0&#39; is the only other digit. count(&#39;0&#39;)=1, which matches T/c=1.This seems to work!Let&#39;s verify:Denominators a=2, b=5, c=10.Digits d1=1, d2=2, d3=5.Check counts:count(d1)=number of &#39;1&#39;s in fractions (4) +1 (mentioned) =5.

Wait, wait, let&#39;s count again:Digits in order:1 (1/2), 2 (1/2), 1 (digit 1), 1 (1/5), 5 (1/5), 2 (digits 2), 5 (digits 5), 1 (1/10), 1 (1/10), 0 (1/10).So:1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 5, 1, 1, 0.Count of &#39;1&#39;s: positions 1,3,4,8,9 → 5 &#39;1&#39;s ✔️.Count of &#39;2&#39;s: positions 2,6 → 2 &#39;2&#39;s ✔️.Count of &#39;5&#39;s: positions 5,7 → 2 &#39;5&#39;s ✔️.Count of &#39;0&#39;s: position 10 →1 &#39;0&#39; ✔️.Yes, this works!

We need to replace the stars with digits and the ellipses with numbers such that the sum of these fractions is equal to 1.    - The equation can be written as:       [      frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} = 1      ]4. From Vasya’s phrase, the number of digits that are not &#39;3&#39; or &#39;1&#39; is inferred to be less significant due to shares of 1/3 and 1/2. Thus, simpler fractions will be considered.    - To be appropriate, x and y should match natural denominators that fit our limits since the resulting number needs to be manageable.5. Assume the smallest values that satisfy these conditions without falling into contradictions:    - Let &#39;A&#39; and &#39;B&#39; each have a share of 1/5, which would make the sum of their fractions 2/5.    - The remaining share needs to fill the remaining difference to 1.6. Because Kolya&#39;s fractions of digits &#39;1&#39; and the two same other digits sum to frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{5} = frac{5}{10} + frac{4}{10} = frac{9}{10}, this leaves a fraction frac{1}{10} for other digits.7. Therefore,    - The two other digits must each have a share of 1/5.    - The remaining digit must indeed have a share of 1/10.8. Practical steps for solution confirmation:    - Since frac{1}{2} for digit &#39;1&#39; and frac{1}{5 + 1/5 + 1/10} tally correctly to 1, let’s verify by assigning actual digits.9. Conclusion:    - The correct digits and corresponding shares are:       [      text{In this phrase } frac{1}{2} text{ of all digits are 1, the shares of digits } 2 text{ and } 5 text{ are equal and each is } frac{1}{5}, text{ and the share of all other digits is } frac{1}{10}.      ] Final Answer:[boxed{text{&quot;In this phrase } frac{1}{2} text{ of all digits are 1, the shares of digits 2 and 5 are equal and each is }frac{1}{5}, text{ and the share of all other digits is }frac{1}{10}text{&quot;}}]</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-21d70c08><span data-v-21d70c08>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.543x.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 Thoughts</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
