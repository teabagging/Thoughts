ðŸŒŸ Open Thoughts: Curating the Best Open Reasoning Datasets
**Open Thoughts** is a community effort by DataComp and Bespoke Labs to curate the best open reasoning datasets. Our first goal is to create a reasoning dataset to train state-of-the-art small reasoning models that surpass DeepSeek-R1-Distill-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B on math and code reasoning benchmarks.
